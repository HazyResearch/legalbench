In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets.

We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	No

Our Dollar Tree segment is the leading operator of discount variety stores offering merchandise at the fixed price point of $1.00. The Dollar Tree segment includes 6,650 stores operating under the Dollar Tree and Dollar Tree Canada brands, 11 distribution centers in the United States and two in Canada and a Store Support Center in Chesapeake, Virginia. Our stores predominantly range from 8,000 - 10,000 selling square feet. In our Dollar Tree stores in the United States, we sell all items for $1.00 or less and in our Dollar Tree Canada stores, we sell all items for $1.25(CAD) or less. We strive to exceed our customers' expectations of the variety and quality of products that they can purchase for $1.00 by offering items that we believe typically sell for higher prices elsewhere. We buy approximately 58% to 60% of our merchandise domestically and import the remaining 40% to 42%. Our domestic purchases include basic, seasonal, home, closeouts and promotional merchandise. We believe our mix of imported and domestic merchandise affords our buyers flexibility that allows them to consistently exceed our customer's expectations. In addition, direct relationships with manufacturers permit us to select from a broad range of products and customize packaging, product sizes and package quantities that meet our customers' needs.  The addition of frozen and refrigerated merchandise to more of our Dollar Tree stores has been one of our ongoing initiatives. We added freezers and coolers to 420 additional stores in 2017. As of February 3, 2018, we have freezers and coolers in approximately 5,205 of our Dollar Tree stores. The remaining items are pushed to the stores and a portion can be reordered by our store managers on a weekly basis. Through automatic replenishment and our store managers' ability to order product, each store manager is able to satisfy the demands of their particular customer base.  We maintain a balanced selection of products within traditional variety store categories. We offer a wide selection of everyday basic products and we supplement these basic, everyday items with seasonal, closeout and promotional merchandise. We attempt to keep certain basic consumable merchandise in our stores continuously to establish our stores as a destination and increase traffic in our stores. Closeout and promotional merchandise is purchased opportunistically and represents less than 10% of our purchases. "	Yes

We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

Waters Corp.	Business General Waters Corporation (the Company, we, our, or us) is a specialty measurement company that operates with a fundamental underlying purpose to advance the science that enables our customers to enhance human health and well-being. The Company has pioneered analytical workflow solutions involving liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and thermal analysis innovations serving the life, materials and food sciences for more than 60 years. The Company primarily designs, manufactures, sells and services high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC TM  and together with HPLC, referred to as LC) and mass spectrometry (MS) technology systems and support products, including chromatography columns, other consumable products and comprehensive post-warranty service plans. These systems are complementary products that are frequently employed together (LC-MS) and sold as integrated instrument systems using common software platforms. In addition, the Company designs, manufactures, sells and services thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments through its TA TM product line. The Company is also a developer and supplier of advanced software-based products that interface with the Companys instruments, as well as other manufacturers instruments.  The Companys products are used by pharmaceutical, biochemical, industrial, nutritional safety, environmental, academic and governmental customers working in research and development, quality assurance and other laboratory applications. LC is a standard technique and is utilized in a broad range of industries to detect, identify, monitor and measure the chemical, physical and biological composition of materials, and to purify a full range of compounds. MS technology, principally in conjunction with chromatography, is employed in drug discovery and development, including clinical trial testing, the analysis of proteins in disease processes (known as proteomics), nutritional safety analysis and environmental testing. LC-MS instruments combine a liquid phase sample introduction and separation system with mass spectrometric compound identification and quantification. The Companys thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments are used in predicting the suitability and stability of fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals, water, polymers, metals and viscous liquids for various industrial, consumer goods and healthcare products, as well as for life science research.  Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited in September 1997.  The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instrument systems, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. Waters Products and Markets High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLCs performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.  The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing.  In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC TM , to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Companys software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC.	Yes

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies, including Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg, a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. We have a pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including Parkinson's disease and MS.  We currently derive substantially all our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. In March 2017, we announced a decision by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers upholding our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, we expect to maintain patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra at least through July 30, 2018, depending on the outcome of appeal of the District Court's decision. The defendant generic drug manufacturers have appealed the District Court's decision upholding the patent that expires in July 2018, and we have appealed the ruling on the four invalidated patents. We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court's decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. If the appeals court does not overturn the District Court's decision by July 30, 2018, multiple ANDA filers may be able to launch generic versions of Ampyra absent injunctive relief. Inbrija, our most advanced development program, is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, being investigated for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson's disease who are taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Inbrija is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. We announced positive Phase 3 efficacy and safety data for this program in 2017. In June 2017, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija to the FDA. In August 2017, we announced that we received a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA regarding the Inbrija NDA. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA specified two reasons for the RTF: first, the date when the manufacturing site would be ready for inspection; and second, a question regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The resubmission addressed the two issues raised in the RTF and included all additional information requested by the FDA in the RTF. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the resubmitted NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA, and that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set a target date of October 5, 2018. Our commercial preparations for the launch of Inbrija continue. We expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2018. In November 2017, we discontinued our clinical development program for tozadenant, an investigational treatment for reduction of OFF time in people with Parkinson' We made this decision based on new information obtained from our Phase 3 clinical trials related to agranulocytosis and associated serious adverse events.  In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive Fampyra royalties payable to us by Biogen, up to an agreed upon threshold of royalties. We believe that operating expense reductions from the restructuring, as well as additional expense reductions due to termination of the tozadenant development program, will enable us to fund operations through launch of Inbrija in the U.S., pending approval from the FDA.

Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. Our Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and manage the portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. Since then, we've evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done.

We're also working hard to make sure that our products are accessible to the more than one billion individuals around the world with a disability. For example, Android 10 has automatic Live Captions for videos, podcasts and voicemails to make it easier to consume information on the phone.  For instance, as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo is working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.  People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations.

We believe Shurgard Europe is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  We also manage approximately 27 self-storage facilities for third parties . We are seeking to expand our third-party management operations to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand; however, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. We also own 0.9 million net rentable square feet of commercial space which is managed primarily by PSB .  For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code"") . and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.  We believe that our customers generally store their goods within a five mile radius of their home or business . Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities. There has been an increase in supply of newly constructed self-storage facilities in several of our markets, most notably Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, and New York.  Ownership and operation of self- storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.

Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

In connection with the Third Repricing Amendment, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $0.8 million, including the discount and write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in debt extinguishment costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Tenth Amendment, among other things, (i) amended the negative covenant regarding dispositions, (ii) modified the collateral package to release any real property with a fair market value of less than $5.0 million and (iii) changed certain investment, indebtedness and lien baskets.

We used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions.  Borrowings under the Tranche B-2 Facility were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of Priory and the fees and expenses for such acquisition and the related financing transactions. Borrowings under the TLA Facility were used to pay down the majority of our $300.0 million revolving credit facility.  The net proceeds to us from the sale of the shares, after deducting the underwriting discount of $15.8 million and additional offering related costs of $0.7 million, were approximately $685.0 million.

There has been an increase in supply of newly constructed self-storage facilities in several of our markets, most notably Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, and New York.  Ownership and operation of self- storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.

Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential.

Alaska Air Group, Inc.	"Virgin America has been a member of Air Group since it was acquired in 2016. In 2018, Virgin America and Alaska combined operating certificates to become a single airline, and legally merged into a single entity. The Company also includes McGee Air Services, an aviation services provider that was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alaska in 2016.  Together with our regional partner airlines, we fly to 115 destinations with over 1,200 daily departures through an expansive network across the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Costa Rica. With global airline partners, we provide our guests with a network of more than 900 destinations worldwide.

We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively. In 2018 , we focused much of our energy on the integration of Virgin America, completing over 95% of our integration milestones. In January 2018, Alaska and Virgin America received a Single Operating Certificate (SOC) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which recognizes Alaska and Virgin America as one airline. In April 2018, we transitioned to a single Passenger Service System (PSS), which allows us to provide one reservation system, one website and one inventory of flights to our guests. This transition to a single PSS enables us to unlock many of the revenue synergies expected from the acquisition, and to provide consistent branding to our guests at all airport gates, ticketing, and check-in areas.  The two most important milestones we have yet to complete include combining the maintenance operations of Boeing and Airbus, and reconfiguring our Airbus fleet. In 2018 , we painted 33 Airbus aircraft with the Alaska livery and we are in process of reconfiguring all Airbus aircraft to achieve a cabin experience for our guests that is consistent with our Boeing fleet.

A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to require drug manufacturers to publicly justify unnecessary price increases.	"Stopping the Pharmaceutical Industry from Keeping Drugs Expensive (SPIKE) Act of 2019

This bill requires manufacturers of drugs with specified percentage increases in their wholesale costs to submit to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) written justification for certain increases in drug prices.

A manufacturer that does not comply with the bill's requirements shall be subject to civil monetary penalties."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	Yes

Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in Gross Domestic Product, or ""GDP.

Plc	Management estimates are derived from publicly available information released by independent industry analysts and third-party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and based on assumptions made by us based on such data and our knowledge of such industry, which we believe to be reasonable. Amarin Corporation plc was originally incorporated in England as a private limited company on March 1, 1989 under the Companies Act 1985, and re-registered in England as a public limited company on March 19, 1993.  Our primary office in the United States is located at 1430 Route 206, Bedminster, NJ 07921, USA. We are a pharmaceutical company with expertise in omega-3 fatty acids and lipid science focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular, or CV, health.  (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride, or TG, levels in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. The primary targeted clinical benefit of lowering triglycerides in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the FDA-approved MARINE indication of patients with severely high (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels, a patient population of approximately 4 million people in the United States.  Our FDA-approved indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in the approved patient population. In considering this approval, the FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels In August 2015, in addition to our FDA-approved indication, we began promoting Vascepa to healthcare professionals, or HCPs, in the United States for the lowering of triglyceride levels and other lipid and lipoprotein parameters in treatment of the patient population studied in the ANCHOR study (persistent high triglycerides after statin therapy). It is estimated that one in four adults in the United States, or more than 50 million people, have elevated (>150 mg/dL) triglyceride levels. We also educated HCPs with supportive but not conclusive early stage and Japanese cardiovascular outcomes trial research on how the unique active ingredient in Vascepa, icosapent ethyl, might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This HCP promotion was based on an August 2015 federal court declaration and subsequent settlement with the FDA and U.S. government that we believe permits such promotion under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To remain truthful and non-misleading, as part of this promotion we educated HCPs on the continued uncertainty between lowering triglycerides and cardiovascular risk reduction based on the failure of other drugs (fenofibrate and formulations of niacin) to demonstrate incremental cardiovascular benefit from adding a second lipid-altering drug on top of standard of care statin therapy, despite such drugs reducing triglyceride levels and having other favorable effects on lipid and lipoprotein parameters. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have shown a significant relative risk reduction, or RRR, of 25% to 35% in the risk of cardiovascular events with statin therapy, leaving significant persistent residual risk despite the achievement of target LDL-C levels. Worldwide, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, remains the number one killer of men and women. In the United States, CVD leads to one in every three deaths—one death approximately every 38 seconds—with annual treatment cost in excess of $500 billion. There is no FDA-approved therapy for lowering cardiovascular risk beyond therapies which target lowering of LDL-C levels.  REDUCE-IT was a global study of 8,179 statin-treated adults with elevated cardiovascular risk. REDUCE-IT met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction, or RRR, to a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.001), in first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population with use of Vascepa 4 grams/day as compared to placebo. Patients who were enrolled in REDUCE-IT needed to have LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides, or TG, between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or be at least age 50 with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort). Approximately 59% of the patients had diabetes at baseline, approximately 71% of the patients had established cardiovascular disease at time of enrollment and approximately 29% were primary prevention subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

A community reclaimer is a person who (1) voluntarily assists a state in a reclamation project, (2) did not participate in the creation of site conditions at the proposed site or activities that caused any land or waters to become eligible for reclamation or drainage abatement expenditures, (3) is not a past or current owner or operator of any site with ongoing reclamation obligations, and (4) is not subject to outstanding violations of surface coal mining permits."	Ralph Lauren Corp.	"General Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, accessories, home furnishings, and other licensed product categories. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across an expanding number of products, brands, sales channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.  Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores and specialty stores around the world. We also sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. In addition, we license to unrelated third parties for specified periods the right to operate retail stores and/or to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.  In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments. Our global reach is extensive, with merchandise available through our wholesale distribution channels at over 12,000 doors worldwide, the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. We also sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 472 retail stores and 632 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 88  Ralph Lauren concession shops, and 136 Club Monaco stores and shops.  We believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our different businesses. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. We have developed a long-term growth strategy with the objective of delivering sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value creation for shareholders. Our strategy includes the following key strategic initiatives: • Elevating our brand through improved quality of sales, distribution, and product; • Evolving product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase reach and appeal with new consumers; •  Expanding our digital and international presence; and •  On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""TCJA""), which became effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA significantly revised U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, lowering the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating a territorial tax system that includes a one-time mandatory transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, and eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions.  We are refocusing on our core brands and evolving our product, marketing, and shopping experience to increase desirability and relevance. We are also evolving our operating model to enable sustainable, profitable sales growth by significantly improving quality of sales, reducing supply chain lead times, improving our sourcing, and executing a disciplined multi-channel distribution and expansion strategy. The Way Forward Plan includes strengthening our leadership team and creating a more nimble organization by moving from an average of nine to six layers of management. The Way Forward Plan also includes the discontinuance of our Denim & Supply brand and the integration of our denim product offerings into our Polo Ralph Lauren brand. Collectively, these actions, which were substantially completed during Fiscal 2017, resulted in a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain stores and shop-within-shops, as well as gross annualized expense savings of approximately $200 million.  (i) the restructuring of our in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development and shifting to a more cost-effective, flexible platform through a new agreement with Salesforce's Commerce Cloud, formerly known as Demandware; (ii) the closure of our Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions in line with the Way Forward Plan."

A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	Yes
A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for a permanent Independence at Home medical practice program under the Medicare program.	"Independence at Home Act of 2019

This bill establishes a permanent Independence at Home Medical Practice Program for Medicare beneficiaries.

"""Align"") is a global medical device company engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign® clear aligners and iTero® intraoral scanners and services for orthodontics, and restorative and aesthetic dentistry. Align's products are intended primarily for the treatment of malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth and are designed to help dental professionals achieve the clinical outcomes that they expect. We sell the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists (""GPs""), as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons. In addition, we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including non-clinical operations, and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products to assist in the provision of oral health care by a licensed dentist. We received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course. Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals and/or labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013. Scanners and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (""CAD/CAM"") services are primarily sold through our direct sales force and a few distributors in North America, Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries, and through distribution partners in smaller non-core international country markets.  Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the population. Annually, approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor's office. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.  The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic, removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases: Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient's treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a digital scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane (or ""PVS"") impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional's election, x-rays of the patient's dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Align's iTero scanner or a few qualified third-party scanners. See ""Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission. "" More than 63% of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression.  Using propriety software which we do not sell, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan.

Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.	"Inc. (""Accelerate"") is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the fast diagnosis of serious infections. Microbiology laboratories are in need of new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the ""CDC"") calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of our time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise of resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by a lack of timely diagnostic results. The delay of identification and antibiotic susceptibility results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories on traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to complete. Our technology platform is built to address these challenges by delivering significantly faster testing of infectious pathogens in various patient sample types.  Our first system to address these challenges is the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Accelerate Pheno™ system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID) infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial and fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antimicrobial. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, which is the first test kit for the system, provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. This information is used to rapidly modify antibiotic therapy to lessen side-affects, improve clinical outcomes, and help preserve the useful life of antibiotics.  In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79/EC and applied a CE Mark to the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit for in vitro diagnostic use. On February 23, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") granted our de novo request to market our Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit.  In 2017, we began selling the Accelerate Pheno™ system in hospitals in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Consistent with the Company's ""razor"" / ""razor-blade"" business model, revenues to date have principally been generated from the sale of the instruments and the sale of single use consumable test kits.  From 2001 to 2012, we focused primarily upon furthering the research and development of the OpTest portfolio of technologies (""OpTest"") that we acquired from DDx, Inc. in 2001 and the development of revenue producing products related to that technology. The purchase of OpTest provided us with a proprietary surface chemistry formulation, which led to our OptiChem and other surface chemistry products, and quantitative bio-analytical measurement instruments.  In 2012, our Board of Directors and management team established a new strategic direction for the Company, which was (1) to focus on the internal development, manufacture, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and (2) to discontinue efforts to develop and actively market OptiChem and our other surface chemistry products. Since the adoption of the new strategic direction in 2012, we have made significant investments in research and development personnel, facilities, equipment, and consumables to support the internal development of the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Company has also invested in the hiring of regulatory, manufacturing, quality, sales, and marketing personnel experienced in the manufacture and commercialization of medical devices.  This strategic direction required the Company to raise additional capital, including through the following transactions: 4  In August 2013, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $20.0 million.  This strategic direction coupled with various investments permitted the development, clinical trial and FDA registration, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit. Accelerate has expanded the strategic direction it took in 2012 to include the development of additional test kits, systems, and geographic expansion to advance its mission to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections globally.  Antibiotic resistance poses a significant impact to healthcare, costing the U.S. an estimated $55 billion per year in healthcare and productivity costs. This estimate includes $20 billion in direct costs and $35 billion in indirect costs, such as lost productivity and sick days.

Alphabet, Inc.	That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history -- inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with Android and map the world with Google Maps. Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which, of course, is Google. It also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main Internet products such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. So whether you're a child in a rural village or a professor at an elite university, you can access the same information. We are helping people get online by tailoring digital experiences to the needs of emerging markets. We're also making sure our core Google products are fast and useful, especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns.  For instance, in October 2017, Project Loon within X deployed its network of stratospheric balloons to deliver basic internet connectivity to more than 100,000 people in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.  People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more useful -- it's what allows you to use your voice to ask the Google Assistant for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to see better YouTube recommendations, and to search for people and events in Google Photos. Machine learning is also showing great promise in helping us tackle big issues, like dramatically improving the energy efficiency of our data centers. Across Other Bets, machine learning helps self-driving cars better detect and respond to others on the road, and can also improve the ability of clinicians to detect diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.  We have always been a company committed to making big bets that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google's core products and platforms such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems. As the majority of Alphabet's big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus that we' Instead of just showing ten blue links in our search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for. You can also type or talk with the Google Assistant in a conversational way across multiple devices like phones, speakers, headphones, televisions and more. And with Google Lens, you can now use your phone's camera to identify an unfamiliar landmark or find a trailer from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily -- like Google Maps, which helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos.  This drive to make information more accessible has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content, on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are consuming more digital content by watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before. Working with content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content. 	No

HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown promising initial results in clinical trials with a 50% response rate and a median projected overall survival of 120 weeks (~28 months) in Cohort 1 of synovial sarcoma (a solid tumor) and 76% overall response rate at day 100 in multiple myeloma. We have also now seen three partial responses (two confirmed and one to be confirmed) and one stable disease in the first four patients dosed in a second solid tumor indication, MRCLS. Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted PRIME regulatory access for our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication.  In September 2017, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) exercised its option to obtain an exclusive global license to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. Upon transition of the NY-ESO program to GSK which is anticipated to occur during 2018, GSK will assume full responsibility for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell including progression of the SPEAR T-cell into further clinical trials.  In January 2018, we announced that we had successfully manufactured the first SPEAR T-cells for a patient at our Navy Yard facility in Philadelphia. We intend to use the facility to manufacture SPEAR T-cells for all three of our wholly owned programs. In addition in January 2018 we also announced an agreement with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult for vector production in the U.K., which is intended to ensure vector supply for our ongoing and future clinical studies.  Our SPEAR T-cell platform is being utilized with the aim of maximizing both patient and disease indication coverage in a number of different ways.  · We are using our platform to identify and validate cancer targets for development of SPEAR T-cells in multiple indications. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target antigens within selected disease indications to increase treatment potential for any given disease. For example the NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells address targets expressed in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.  · We are also developing SPEAR T-cells directed to targets which are closely related to a specific disease indication. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also being validated.  1 · Finally, we are identifying peptides to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types ensuring that for any given target, for example NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 or AFP, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.

This bill requires the Office of Science and Technology Policy of the Executive Office of the President to establish an interagency working group to (1) provide a strategic vision of extreme weather resilience; (2) conduct an analysis of current and planned federal activities related to achieving short- and long-term resilience to extreme weather and its impacts on the United States, such as flooding, drought, and wildfires; and (3) develop a National Extreme Weather Resilience Action Plan.

The plan must include (1) the establishment of an online portal that directs users to key data and tools to inform resilience-enhancing efforts; and (2) the identification of a coordinating entity to establish and maintain such portal and to coordinate the implementation of the plan and track its progress."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	No

"Veterans, Women, Families with Children, Race, and Persons with Disabilities Housing Fairness Act of 2019 or the Housing Fairness Act of 2019

This bill provides for testing to detect housing discrimination and awards grants to study the causes and effects of such discrimination.

Specifically, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) must conduct a nationwide testing program to (1) detect and document differences in the treatment of prospective renters, homebuyers, or mortgage borrowers; (2) measure patterns of adverse treatment because of the race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability status, or national origin of a renter, homebuyer, or borrower; and (3) measure the prevalence of such discriminatory practices across housing and mortgage lending markets.

The bill also increases funding for the fair housing initiative program in FY2020-FY2024.

Additionally, HUD shall implement a grant program to assist public and private nonprofit organizations in (1) conducting comprehensive studies of the causes and effects of housing discrimination and segregation on education, poverty, and economic development or on veterans and military personnel; and (2) implementing pilot projects that test solutions to help prevent or alleviate housing discrimination and segregation."	Public Storage	"could adversely impact our operations or our business , customer, and employee relationships or result in fraudulent payments;  risks associated with the self-insurance of certain business risks, including property and casualty insurance, employee health insurance and workers compensation liabilities;  difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost;  delays and cost overruns on our projects to develop or expand our facilities;  ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions that may divert management's time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business; and  economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism.  We acquire, develop, own and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2019, we have direct and indirect equity interests in 2,483 self-storage facilities that we consolidate (an aggregate of 169 million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the ""Public Storage"" brand name.  (ii) Ancillary Operations : We reinsure policies against losses to goods stored by customers in our self-storage facilities and sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes, at our self-storage facilities.  Inc. (""PSB""), a publicly held REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office, and industrial parks. At December 31, 2019, PSB owns and operates 27.6 million rentable square feet of commercial space.  We have a 35% equity interest in Shurgard Self Storage SA (""Shurgard""), a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the ""SHUR"" symbol, which owns 234 self-storage facilities (13 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe operated under the ""Shurgard"" brand name. We believe Shurgard is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  In order to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand, in 2018 we began an effort to expand the number of facilities we manage, through a dedicated internal sales, administration, and implementation team. At December 31, 2019, we are under contract to manage 27 additional facilities, currently under construction, following their completion. We also own 0.9 million net rentable square feet of commercial space which is managed primarily by PSB.  For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.  We believe that our customers generally store their goods within a three to five mile radius of their home or business. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets where we operate, due to the favorable economics of developing new properties. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 16%, with the remaining 84% owned by regional and local operators.  The high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level 6 of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale."

Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc.	"Inc. (""Accelerate"") is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections. Microbiology laboratories are in need of new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of our time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise of resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by a lack of timely diagnostic results. The delay of identification and antibiotic susceptibility results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories on traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to complete. Our technology platform is built to address these challenges by delivering significantly faster and more accurate testing of infectious pathogens in various patient sample types.  Since 2004, we have focused our efforts on the research, development, and commercialization of an innovative rapid diagnostic platform, the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Accelerate Pheno™ system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID) infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing, (AST) which determines whether live bacterial and fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antibiotic. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit is a highly multiplexed panel targeting over 80% of the routine and significant pathogens causing blood stream infections and over 90% of the antibiotics useful in treating those pathogens.  In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79 EC and applied a CE Mark to the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit for in vitro diagnostic use. On February 23, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") granted our de novo request to market our Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit.  In 2017, we began selling the Accelerate Pheno™ system in hospitals in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Consistent with the Company's business model revenues were generated from the sale of the instrument and the sale of single use consumable test kits.  From 2001 to 2012, we focused primarily upon furthering the research and development of the OpTest portfolio of technologies (""OpTest"") that we acquired from DDx, Inc. in 2001 and the development of revenue producing products related to that technology. The purchase of OpTest provided us with a proprietary surface chemistry formulation, which led to our OptiChem and other surface chemistry products, and quantitative bio-analytical measurement instruments.  In 2012, our Board of Directors and management team established a new strategic direction for the Company, which was (1) to focus on the internal development, manufacture, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and (2) to discontinue efforts to develop and actively market OptiChem and our other surface chemistry products. Our Board of Directors and management team decided to pursue this new strategic direction based on the belief that we could internally develop and commercialize the Accelerate Pheno™ system, formerly called the BacCel System.  Since the adoption of the new strategic direction in 2012, we have made significant investments in research and development personnel, facilities, equipment, and consumables to support the internal development of the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Company has also invested in the hiring of regulatory, manufacturing, quality, sales, and marketing personnel experienced in the manufacture and commercialization of medical devices.  In August 2013, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $20.0 million. In April 2014, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $45.0 million. Antibiotic resistance has a significant healthcare impact, costing the U.S. an estimated $55 billion per year in healthcare and productivity costs. This estimate includes $20 billion in direct costs and $35 billion in indirect costs, such as lost productivity and sick days. Increasing infection rates and misuse of antibiotics results in serious treatment complications. Recent studies have shown that the number of hospital-acquired infections in the United States ranges from 214,700 to 1.4 million per year, contributing to an estimated 75,000 deaths per year."	Yes

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and related products in the United States. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2017, we operated 351 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this market area.  The irrigation industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize long‑term growth rates similar to the pool industry. As irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction, we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant growth opportunities for the irrigation industry.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic, along with relatively consistent annual inflationary price increases of 1% to 2% on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors, has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2016 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool, outdoor living and irrigation products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market. Irrigation activities account for approximately 50% of total spending in the irrigation industry, with the remaining 50% of spending related to power equipment, landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories. Over the last five years, our irrigation business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of single-family home construction as irrigation system installations and landscape projects typically correlate with, but lag, new home construction.

Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018.

We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.

Our primary office in the United States is located at 1430 Route 206, Bedminster, NJ 07921, USA. We are a pharmaceutical company with expertise in omega-3 fatty acids and lipid science focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular, or CV, health.  (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride, or TG, levels in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. The primary targeted clinical benefit of lowering triglycerides in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the FDA-approved MARINE indication of patients with severely high (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels, a patient population of approximately 4 million people in the United States.  Our FDA-approved indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in the approved patient population. In considering this approval, the FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels In August 2015, in addition to our FDA-approved indication, we began promoting Vascepa to healthcare professionals, or HCPs, in the United States for the lowering of triglyceride levels and other lipid and lipoprotein parameters in treatment of the patient population studied in the ANCHOR study (persistent high triglycerides after statin therapy). It is estimated that one in four adults in the United States, or more than 50 million people, have elevated (>150 mg/dL) triglyceride levels. We also educated HCPs with supportive but not conclusive early stage and Japanese cardiovascular outcomes trial research on how the unique active ingredient in Vascepa, icosapent ethyl, might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This HCP promotion was based on an August 2015 federal court declaration and subsequent settlement with the FDA and U.S. government that we believe permits such promotion under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To remain truthful and non-misleading, as part of this promotion we educated HCPs on the continued uncertainty between lowering triglycerides and cardiovascular risk reduction based on the failure of other drugs (fenofibrate and formulations of niacin) to demonstrate incremental cardiovascular benefit from adding a second lipid-altering drug on top of standard of care statin therapy, despite such drugs reducing triglyceride levels and having other favorable effects on lipid and lipoprotein parameters. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have shown a significant relative risk reduction, or RRR, of 25% to 35% in the risk of cardiovascular events with statin therapy, leaving significant persistent residual risk despite the achievement of target LDL-C levels. Worldwide, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, remains the number one killer of men and women. In the United States, CVD leads to one in every three deaths—one death approximately every 38 seconds—with annual treatment cost in excess of $500 billion. There is no FDA-approved therapy for lowering cardiovascular risk beyond therapies which target lowering of LDL-C levels.  REDUCE-IT was a global study of 8,179 statin-treated adults with elevated cardiovascular risk. REDUCE-IT met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction, or RRR, to a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.001), in first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population with use of Vascepa 4 grams/day as compared to placebo. Patients who were enrolled in REDUCE-IT needed to have LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides, or TG, between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or be at least age 50 with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort). Approximately 59% of the patients had diabetes at baseline, approximately 71% of the patients had established cardiovascular disease at time of enrollment and approximately 29% were primary prevention subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

To provide for the coverage of medically necessary food and vitamins and individual amino acids for digestive and inherited metabolic disorders under Federal health programs and private health insurance, and for other purposes.	"Medical Nutrition Equity Act of 2019

This bill expands coverage under Medicare, Medicaid, other specified federal health-care programs, and private health insurance to include foods, vitamins, and individual amino acids that are medically necessary for the management of certain digestive and metabolic disorders and conditions."	Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. APO(a)-L Rx , AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx , AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx , are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform. Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.  TEGSEDI is the world's first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea's first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea Connect TM , a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country. Internationally, Akcea Connect is being rolled out in each of the countries where we launch with what we believe is the highest level of patient and physician support allowed in accordance with local regulations. Accredo to be our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Express Scripts' Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo because of their experience supporting the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and over 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass™ in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis.

To significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients'  lives through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic diseases, or RGDs, which are diseases that are directly caused by changes in genes or chromosomes, often passed from one generation to the next. The incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally very infrequent, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000 births. In both areas of cancer and RGDs, we are seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies.  Our first commercial cancer product is IDHIFA®. In August 2017, the FDA granted our collaboration partner Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, approval of IDHIFA® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML, and an IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IDHIFA®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation.  Our most advanced clinical cancer product candidates are ivosidenib, which targets mutated IDH1, and AG-881, which is a brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor. In December 2017, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for ivosidenib for the treatment of patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. We plan to submit an MAA to the EMA for ivosidenib for IDH1 mutant-positive R/R AML in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Our next most advanced cancer product candidate is AG-270, an inhibitor of MAT2A. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AG-270 in November 2017, and in December 2017 the FDA concluded that we may proceed with our planned phase 1 dose-escalation trial of AG-270 in multiple tumor types carrying a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deletion. We expect to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2018.  Our most advanced preclinical cancer product candidate is an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme DHODH. We plan to submit an IND for our DHODH inhibitor for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The lead product candidate in our RGD program, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase, or PK, deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice and lifelong conditions associated with chronic anemia and secondary complications due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells, or RBCs. We intend to initiate two global, pivotal trials of AG-348 in PK deficiency in the first half of 2018: ACTIVATE-T, a single arm trial of approximately 20 regularly transfused patients, is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2018, and ACTIVATE, a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 80 patients who do not receive regular transfusions, is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2018. We also expect to initiate a phase 2 proof of concept trial of AG-348 in thalassemia in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned development programs, we are seeking to advance a number of early-stage discovery programs in the areas of cancer metabolism, RGDs and metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, a developing field which aims to modulate the activity of relevant immune cells by targeting critical metabolic nodes, thereby, enhancing the immune mediated anti-tumor response.  The clinical development strategy for all of our product and development candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our expertise in ""flux biochemistry. This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple networks of metabolic enzymes."

Using our affinity engineered TCRs, we aim to become the first company to have a TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication.  All SPEAR T-cells are currently exhibiting acceptable tolerability profiles with no evidence of off-target toxicities observed.  · Two Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing with ADP-A2M10. The first clinical trial is in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC""). The second clinical trial is in patients with three cancer tumor types, urothelial, melanoma and head and neck cancers. Both trials have progressed to the expansion phase, with patients being treated with up to 10 billion transduced SPEAR T-cells.  · A Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing with ADP-A2M4 in bladder, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, NSCLC, synovial sarcoma, myxoid round cell liposarcoma (""MRCLS""), esophageal, and gastric cancers. This trial is now in the expansion phase with patients being treated with up to 10 billion transduced SPEAR T-cells.  · A Phase 1 clinical trial is ongoing with ADP-A2AFP in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The trial is in the dose escalation phase with patients receiving a target dose of 1 billion transduced SPEAR T-cells.  A fourth SPEAR T-cell, the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell was transitioned to GlaxoSmithKline (""GSK"") during 2018 following GSK's exercise of its option to obtain an exclusive global license to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program in September 2017. GSK has assumed full responsibility for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell including progression of this SPEAR T-cell into further clinical trials.  We have our own manufacturing facility in the United States that routinely manufactures SPEAR T-cells to treat patients across a broad range of solid tumors. We also have dedicated vector manufacturing in the United Kingdom and we anticipate producing our first batch of vector to support pilot clinical trials in 2019, which will enable us to continue to develop enhancements and improvements with the aim of reducing the time taken to manufacture and supply patient product.  We continue to use our SPEAR T-cell platform to identify and validate further cancer targets (including targets which are closely related to a specific disease indication) to which SPEAR T-cells can be directed. In addition to our internal next generation programs, we also have collaborations with third parties intended to promote further next generation solutions. With Universal Cells, we are looking to develop affinity engineered donor T-cells that are universally applicable to all patients. While these ""off-the shelf cells"" would be specific for a given Human Leukocyte Antigen (""HLA"") type and target antigen, they would overcome the current limitation of autologous therapies that need to be manufactured specifically for each patient. The enhanced T-cell technology being developed involves selective engineering of cell surface proteins, without the use of nucleases, to develop these T-cell products. Our strategic objective is to be a world leader in discovering, developing and commercializing TCR-based T-cell therapies that transform the clinical outcomes of patients with cancer. We have an ambition to have the first TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication. We plan to advance these wholly-owned SPEAR T-cells during 2019 with the aim of providing initial clinical data for ADP-A2M10 and ADP-A2M4 during the first half of 2019."	Yes

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODIT TM , is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.  Our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations for the trea tment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We submitted a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for AR101 to the FDA in December 2018. The FDA initiated review of the BLA for AR101 in January 2019, and we expect that the FDA will determine whether the BLA has been accepted for filing by the end of March 2019. The FDA has made an initial determination that AR101, as an allergenic product candidate, is exempt from the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, as amended, or PDUFA. However, we believe the FDA has had policies that pre-date and post-date PDUFA that would allow for expedited review of PDUFA-exempt applications , and we are currently engaged in discussions with the FDA regarding the review timeline for the AR101 BLA. If the Breakthrough Therapy designation for AR101 does not result in an expedited review of the BLA for AR101, the BLA will likely be reviewed under a twelve-month target review period applicable to PDUFA-exempt applications as measured from the January 2019 start date.  Our initial target patient population for AR101 is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group with a diagnosed peanut allergy, which we estimate applied to approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018. We expect to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the first half of 2019. We maintain worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates, including AR101 and, if approved, currently intend to commercialize in the United States and Europe by developing a specialty sales force targeting practicing allergists in the United States and allergy-focused clinicians in major European markets.  We are in the process of developing formulations for additional CODIT product candidates beyond peanut allergy and have formulation and manufacturing activities ongoing for a product candidate designed to treat egg allergy, AR201. We are also exploring a product candidate designed to treat multi-nut allergy, including walnut allergy. Review of our investigational new drug application, or IND, for AR201 was completed by the FDA in February 2019. As such, we have been cleared to advance AR201 into a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we expect to commence in mid-2019. In addition, we are also conducting research and development activities for potential CODIT product candidates targeting other food allergies, including cow's milk allergy.  Our goal is to build a biopharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes proprietary therapies to improve the lives of food-allergic patients and their families. Complete development and obtain approval of AR101 in the United States and Europe for the treatment of peanut allergy : We submitted the AR101 BLA in the United States in December 2018 and intend to file a MAA, for AR101 in the European Union in the first half of 2019.

Alliance Resource Partners LP	"We are a diversified producer and marketer of coal primarily to major United States (""U.S."") utilities and industrial users. We began mining operations in 1971 and, since then, have grown through acquisitions and internal development to become the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. In 2017, we sold 37.8 million tons of coal and produced 37.6 million tons of coal, of which 25.4% was low-sulfur coal, 39.9% was medium-sulfur coal and 34.7% was high-sulfur coal. In 2017, we sold 80.0% of our total tons to electric utilities, of which 100% was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.  We operate eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia. We also operate a coal loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. In addition, we own equity interests in various oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. Our mining activities are conducted in two geographic regions commonly referred to in the coal industry as the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions. We have grown historically primarily through expansion of our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in these regions.  AHGP is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed to become the owner and controlling member of MGP. We produce a diverse range of steam and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers.

Alkermes Plc	"Alkermes plc is a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical company that applies its scientific expertise and proprietary technologies to research, develop and commercialize, both with partners and on its own, pharmaceutical products that are designed to address unmet medical needs of patients in major therapeutic areas. Alkermes has a diversified portfolio of marketed drug products and a clinical pipeline of product candidates focused on central nervous system (""CNS"") disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis (""MS""), and oncology. Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Alkermes has a research and development (""R & D"") center in Waltham, Massachusetts; an R & D and manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland; and a manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio.  The key marketed products discussed below are expected to generate significant revenues for us. Territory Initiation or re- initiation of ARISTADA for  (""CIS"") 5 Summary information regarding products that use our proprietary technologies: Product Indication(s)  We develop and commercialize products designed to address the unmet needs of patients suffering from addiction and schizophrenia.  ARISTADA ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release intramuscular injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA is the first of our products to utilize our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is the first atypical antipsychotic with four dosing options—once-monthly (441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg), once-every-six-weeks (882 mg) and once-every-two-months (1064 mg)— to deliver and maintain therapeutic levels of medication in the body. We developed ARISTADA and manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.  ARISTADA INITIO ARISTADA INITIO (aripiprazole lauroxil), in combination with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, is indicated for the initiation of ARISTADA when used for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults. ARISTADA INITIO leverages our proprietary NanoCrystal technology and provides an extended-release formulation of aripiprazole lauroxil in a smaller particle size compared to ARISTADA. This smaller particle size enables faster dissolution and leads to more rapid achievement of relevant levels of aripiprazole. The ARISTADA INITIO regimen, consisting of a single injection of 675 mg ARISTADA INITIO in combination with a single 30 mg dose of oral aripiprazole, when used to initiate onto any dose of ARISTADA, provides patients with relevant levels of aripiprazole within four days of treatment initiation. We developed ARISTADA INITIO and exclusively manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.  Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. The disease is marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal), as well as by disorganized thinking. Approximately 3.5 million people are diagnosed with schizophrenia in the U.S., with men and women affected equally. Worldwide, it is estimated that one person in every 100 develops schizophrenia. Studies have demonstrated that as many as 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral medication on a regular basis, which can lead to worsening of symptoms.  VIVITROL VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly, non-narcotic, injectable medication approved in the U.S., Russia and certain countries of the CIS for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL."	No
To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.

Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.	"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	Yes

As of December 31, 2018, Altus Midstream's assets included approximately 111 miles of natural gas gathering pipelines, approximately 52 miles of residue gas pipelines with three market connections (with a fourth market connection expected to be in-service by the end of the first quarter of 2019), and approximately 26 miles of NGL Pipelines. Additionally, we own five rich gas processing facilities consisting of approximately 77,000 horsepower with 380 MMcf/d of rich gas processing capacity and two lean gas facilities consisting of 75,000 horsepower with 400 MMcf/d of lean gas treating capacity. Other assets include an NGL truck loading terminal with six lease automatic custody transfer (""LACT"") units and eight NGL bullet tanks with 90,000 gallon capacity per tank. Construction on the assets began in the fourth quarter of 2016, and operations commenced in the second quarter of 2017.  Altus Midstream may acquire an additional 1 percent equity interest, provided that the Permian Highway Option has been exercised (as defined below) and certain other conditions are satisfied. GCX is a long-haul natural gas pipeline that, upon completion, is expected to have capacity of approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and will transport natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas, to the Agua Dulce Hub near the Texas Gulf Coast. In February 2019, Altus Midstream announced the exercise of the option with EPIC Pipeline LP (the ""EPIC Option"") to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline (the ""EPIC Pipeline""). The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2019.  Upon completion, the long-haul crude oil pipeline will extend from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas to the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, and is expected to have Permian Basin initial throughput capacity of approximately 590 MBbl/d. The project includes terminals in Orla, Pecos, Saragosa, Crane, Wink, Midland, Hobson and Gardendale, with Port of Corpus Christi connectivity and export access. These options facilitate our participation in the following third-party pipeline projects: •Salt Creek NGL Pipeline; •  We have an option to acquire a 50 percent equity interest in the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline - an intra-basin NGL pipeline. Upon completion, the pipeline is expected to be capable of transporting approximately 445 MBbl/d from our Diamond cryogenic processing complex in southwest Reeves County, Texas, and Salt Creek Midstream's gas processing complex located in central Reeves County, Texas. The pipeline will transport NGLs to the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas, and will be operated by ARM Midstream Management LLC. It is expected to be operational and in service in the first quarter of 2019 and we expect 2 to exercise this option in the fourth quarter of 2019 or the first quarter of 2020.  We have an option to acquire up to a 33 percent equity interest in the Shin Oak Pipeline, a long-haul NGL pipeline that, upon completion, is expected to be capable of transporting approximately 550 MBbl/d from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas, through the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas, and on to Mont Belvieu, Texas."

BUSINESS Groupon is a global leader in local commerce, making it easy for people around the world to search and discover great businesses and merchandise. Our vision is to connect local commerce, increasing consumer buying power while driving more business to merchants through price and discovery. We want Groupon to be the destination that consumers check first when they are out and about; the place they start when they are looking to buy just about anything, anywhere, anytime. We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet, Groupon is helping local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services.  Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services, generally at a discount. Consumers access those marketplaces through our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries, and our mobile applications.  Our operations are organized into two segments: North America and International. W e offer goods and services through our online marketplaces in three primary categories: We earn product revenue from direct sales of merchandise inventory through our Goods category. We primarily earn service revenue from transactions in which we earn commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Those transactions generally involve a customer's purchase of a voucher through one of our online marketplaces that can be redeemed with a third-party merchant for specified goods or services (or for discounts on specified goods or services). Service revenue also includes commissions that we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications and from voucherless merchant offerings in which customers earn cash back on their credit card statements when they transact with third-party merchants.  The substantial majority of our service revenue transactions is comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. Our goal is to continue to build marketplaces that our customers rely on to discover and save on amazing things to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. With a mobile-first strategy, we intend to improve the customer experience by continuing to invest in innovative, frictionless products and differentiated local supply coupled with strong national brands. As we build out our marketplaces, we want our customers to have a superior, frictionless experience when they use our product whether finding, booking, buying or redeeming an offer. For merchants, this includes providing capabilities to manage demand for their goods and services and improving their ability to acquire customers. For consumers, this includes easily finding offers and accessing features that augment the overall experience, as well as seamlessly purchasing and redeeming offers. We are currently investing in initiatives to improve the purchase and redemption experience, such as enhancing our mobile applications, testing offerings with voucherless redemption resulting in cash back directly to customers' credit cards, and adding direct booking capabilities. We ultimately want Groupon to become a daily habit for our customers and believe that significantly increasing the offerings available through our online local commerce marketplaces is critical to this goal. Our initiatives to grow our inventory of deal offerings include entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, identifying new distribution channels through which to sell our marketplace offerings, and continuing to optimize the activities performed by our sales teams. Additionally, we believe that our efforts to increase our customer value may improve the health of our marketplaces, making our marketing and promotional services more effective for the merchants who feature offerings on our platform.  Our initiatives to grow International gross profit include increasing our international marketing spending and leveraging enhanced marketing analytics, prioritizing more technology resources in order to expand and advance its product and service offerings, growing our inventory of deal offerings by entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, and other initiatives.  We earn revenue from transactions in which we provide marketing services primarily by selling vouchers through our online local marketplaces that can be redeemed for goods or services with third-party merchants.

The Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.	The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the worlds leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Our products are sold in over 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, We are also the global licensee for fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under various designer brand names. Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.  We believe we are a leader in the beauty industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation, our strong position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and High-Touch services. We sell our prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands. These channels consist primarily of department stores, specialty multi-brand retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. In addition, our products are sold in our own and authorized freestanding stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores in airports and on cruise ships, in-flight, and duty-free shops. We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers and consumers, enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and online, and heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.  Our broad range of skin care products addresses various skin care needs. These products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, body care, exfoliators, acne care, facial masks, cleansing devices and sun care products.

To amend titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for drug manufacturer price transparency, to require certain manufacturers to report on product samples provided to certain health care providers, and for other purposes.	"Prescription Drug Sunshine, Transparency, Accountability and Reporting Act or the Prescription Drug STAR Act This bill establishes requirements for prescription drug manufacturers to provide certain information about pricing, discounts, and product samples of applicable drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to annually determine whether there are price increases of a certain threshold for outpatient prescription drugs covered under Medicare, excluding low-cost drugs. Manufacturers must provide HHS with an explanation for drug prices that (1) cumulatively increase by at least 10% or $10,000 over one year; (2) cumulatively increase by at least 25% or $25,000 over three years; or (3) are at least $26,000 annually, per individual, if first covered by Medicare during the applicable year. The manufacturer must explain the role of the factors contributing to such prices and other relevant information, including manufacturing costs, marketing costs, and revenue.

Additionally, drug manufacturers must provide HHS with aggregate data related to product samples of drugs, devices, biologic products, and medical supplies given to hospitals, physicians, or other medical professionals during the previous calendar year, beginning in 2023. The bill further requires HHS to make publicly available the information related to drug discounts, rebates, and price concessions that is provided annually to HHS by group health plans. Drug manufacturers also must report to HHS certain sales information for drugs available under Medicare for which the manufacturer does not have a rebate agreement in place. The bill requires HHS to study and report on trends concerning inpatient hospital drug costs."	Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and commercialization of genetically engineered allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf T cell product candidates that are designed to target and kill cancer cells. Our engineered T cells are allogeneic, meaning they are derived from healthy donors for intended use in any patient, rather than from an individual patient for that patient's use, as in the case of autologous T cells. In collaboration with Servier, we are developing UCART19 and ALLO-501, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates targeting CD19. Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.

Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We are preparing for our launch of commercial sales of Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018. After the adoption of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion, we expect a final decision regarding the MAA from the European Commission before the end of 2019. We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.  Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) : Launching the commercial sale of Inbrija in the U.S.; obtaining approval of our European MAA for Inbrija; and continuing with potential partnering discussions for commercialization outside of the U.S.  ARCUS Platform : Advancing our efforts to develop additional therapeutics based on our proprietary ARCUS pulmonary drug delivery technology, looking at central nervous system, or CNS, as well as non-CNS opportunities, including our program to develop an ARCUS-based treatment for acute migraine.  Company Highlights Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson's Disease Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) is the first and only inhaled levodopa, or L-dopa, for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018.

Public Storage	"could adversely impact our operations or our business , customer, and employee relationships or result in fraudulent payments;  risks associated with the self-insurance of certain business risks, including property and casualty insurance, employee health insurance and workers compensation liabilities;  difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost;  delays and cost overruns on our projects to develop or expand our facilities;  ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions that may divert management's time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business; and  economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism.  We acquire, develop, own and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2019, we have direct and indirect equity interests in 2,483 self-storage facilities that we consolidate (an aggregate of 169 million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the ""Public Storage"" brand name.  (ii) Ancillary Operations : We reinsure policies against losses to goods stored by customers in our self-storage facilities and sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes, at our self-storage facilities.  Inc. (""PSB""), a publicly held REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office, and industrial parks. At December 31, 2019, PSB owns and operates 27.6 million rentable square feet of commercial space.  We have a 35% equity interest in Shurgard Self Storage SA (""Shurgard""), a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the ""SHUR"" symbol, which owns 234 self-storage facilities (13 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe operated under the ""Shurgard"" brand name. We believe Shurgard is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  In order to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand, in 2018 we began an effort to expand the number of facilities we manage, through a dedicated internal sales, administration, and implementation team. At December 31, 2019, we are under contract to manage 27 additional facilities, currently under construction, following their completion. We also own 0.9 million net rentable square feet of commercial space which is managed primarily by PSB.  For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.  We believe that our customers generally store their goods within a three to five mile radius of their home or business. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets where we operate, due to the favorable economics of developing new properties. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 16%, with the remaining 84% owned by regional and local operators.  The high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level 6 of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale."

"We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, marketing and sale of air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils.  Our products serve the commercial and industrial new construction and replacement markets. To date, our sales have been primarily to the domestic market. Our rooftop and condensing unit markets primarily consist of units installed on commercial or industrial structures of generally less than ten stories in height. Our air handling units, self-contained units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms and coils are suitable for all sizes of commercial and industrial buildings.  The size of these markets is determined primarily by the number of commercial and industrial building completions. The replacement market consists of products installed to replace existing units/components that are worn or damaged. Currently, over half of the industry's market consists of replacement units.  The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market.  Based on our 2018 sales of $433.9 million, we estimate that we have approximately a 11% share of the greater than five ton rooftop market and a 2% share of the less than five ton market. During 2018, approximately 50% of our sales were generated from the renovation and replacement markets and 50% from new construction. The percentage of sales for new construction vs. replacement to particular customers is related to the customer's stage of development.  We purchase certain components, fabricate sheet metal and tubing and then assemble and test the finished products. Our primary finished products consist of a single unit system containing heating and cooling in a self-contained cabinet, referred to in the industry as ""unitary products"".

Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing novel cell therapies to patients, particularly in solid tumors. (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and genetically engineer T-cell receptors (TCRs), and produce therapeutic candidates for administration to patients. Using our affinity engineered TCRs, we aim to become a fully integrated cell therapy company and to be the first company to have a TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication.  We have four SPEAR T-cells in clinical trials, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4, AFP and NY-ESO. Phase 1/2 clinical trials are ongoing in patients with various cancer tumor types including urothelial, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, esophageal, gastric, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular cancers and in synovial sarcoma, myxoid round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells have shown promising tolerability profiles with no evidence of off-target toxicities observed. The MAGE-A10 triple tumor study dose escalation to 1 billion transduced cells, which is the dose previously observed to provide responses with our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell, has been recommended by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). In the MAGE-A10 NSCLC study, the SRC has recommended modification of the protocol to permit escalation of the patient dose to 1 billion transduced cells with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide preconditioning in the next treatment cohort. In the MAGE-A4 trial patient enrollment has started in bladder, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, NSCLC, esophageal and gastric cancers.  Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown promising initial results in clinical trials with a 50% response rate and a median projected overall survival of 120 weeks (~28 months) in Cohort 1 of synovial sarcoma (a solid tumor) and 76% overall response rate at day 100 in multiple myeloma. We have also now seen three partial responses (two confirmed and one to be confirmed) and one stable disease in the first four patients dosed in a second solid tumor indication, MRCLS. Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted PRIME regulatory access for our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication.  In September 2017, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) exercised its option to obtain an exclusive global license to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. Upon transition of the NY-ESO program to GSK which is anticipated to occur during 2018, GSK will assume full responsibility for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell including progression of the SPEAR T-cell into further clinical trials.  In January 2018, we announced that we had successfully manufactured the first SPEAR T-cells for a patient at our Navy Yard facility in Philadelphia. We intend to use the facility to manufacture SPEAR T-cells for all three of our wholly owned programs. In addition in January 2018 we also announced an agreement with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult for vector production in the U.K., which is intended to ensure vector supply for our ongoing and future clinical studies.  Our SPEAR T-cell platform is being utilized with the aim of maximizing both patient and disease indication coverage in a number of different ways.  · We are using our platform to identify and validate cancer targets for development of SPEAR T-cells in multiple indications. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target antigens within selected disease indications to increase treatment potential for any given disease. For example the NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells address targets expressed in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.  · We are also developing SPEAR T-cells directed to targets which are closely related to a specific disease indication. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also being validated.  1 · Finally, we are identifying peptides to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types ensuring that for any given target, for example NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 or AFP, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.

Align's products are intended primarily for the treatment of malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth and are designed to help dental professionals achieve the clinical outcomes that they expect. We sell the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists (""GPs""), as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons. In addition, we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including non-clinical operations, and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products to assist in the provision of oral health care by a licensed dentist. We received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course. Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals and/or labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013. Scanners and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (""CAD/CAM"") services are primarily sold through our direct sales force and a few distributors in North America, Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries, and through distribution partners in smaller non-core international country markets.  Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the population. Annually, approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor's office. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.  The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic, removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases: Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient's treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a digital scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane (or ""PVS"") impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional's election, x-rays of the patient's dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Align's iTero scanner or a few qualified third-party scanners. See ""Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission. "" More than 63% of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression.  Using propriety software which we do not sell, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan. Attachments are tooth-colored ""buttons"" that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement(s).

Since the IPO, the Company has added two significant and complementary technologies to its range of products with the acquisitions of TA Instruments in May 1996 and Micromass Limited in September 1997.  The Waters operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing LC and MS instrument systems, columns and other precision chemistry consumables that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments. The TA operating segment is primarily in the business of designing, manufacturing, selling and servicing thermal analysis, rheometry and calorimetry instruments. Waters Products and Markets High Performance and Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC is a standard technique used to identify and analyze the constituent components of a variety of chemicals and other materials. The Company believes that HPLCs performance capabilities enable it to separate, identify and quantify a high proportion of all known chemicals. As a result, HPLC is used to analyze substances in a wide variety of industries for research and development purposes, quality control and process engineering applications.  The most significant end-use markets for HPLC are those served by the pharmaceutical and life science industries. In these markets, HPLC is used extensively to understand diseases, identify new drugs, develop manufacturing methods and assure the potency and purity of new pharmaceuticals. HPLC is also used in a variety of other applications, such as analyses of foods and beverages for nutritional labeling and compliance with safety regulations and the testing of water and air purity within the environmental testing industry, as well as applications in other industries, such as chemical and consumer products. HPLC is also used by universities, research institutions and governmental agencies, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and their foreign counterparts that mandate safety and efficacy testing.  In 2004, Waters introduced a novel technology that the Company describes as ultra performance liquid chromatography that utilizes a packing material with small, uniform diameter particles and a specialized instrument, the ACQUITY UPLC TM , to accommodate the increased pressure and narrower chromatographic bands that are generated by these small and tightly packed particles. By using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers and analysts are able to achieve more comprehensive chemical separations and faster analysis times in comparison with many analyses previously performed by HPLC. In addition, in using the ACQUITY UPLC, researchers have the potential to extend the range of applications beyond that of HPLC, enabling them to uncover more levels of scientific information. While offering significant performance advantages, the ACQUITY UPLC is also compatible with the Companys software products and the general operating protocols of HPLC.	No
To amend the Social Security Act to establish a Medicare for America health program to provide for comprehensive health coverage for all Americans.	"Medicare for America Act of 2019

This bill establishes several health insurance programs and otherwise modifies certain requirements relating to health care coverage, costs, and services.

In particular, the bill establishes a national health insurance program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) cover specified items and services, including hospital services, prescription drugs, dental services, and home- and community-based long-term care; and (3) be fully implemented in 2023. HHS must also offer a transitional public health option that provides certain minimum coverage through health insurance exchanges in 2021 and 2022.

The bill also makes a series of other changes to health care and tax provisions. For example, the bill (1) allows federal funds to be used for abortions; (2) sunsets a specified tax reform law that, among other things, repealed the penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health coverage; and (3) prohibits excessive prices for prescription drugs and medical devices, as determined by a newly established federal regulatory board."	Alector, Inc.	Our mission is to develop therapies that empower the immune system to cure neurodegeneration.  We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering immuno-neurology, a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of neurodegeneration. Immuno-neurology targets immune dysfunction as a root cause of multiple pathologies that are drivers of degenerative brain disorders. We are developing therapies designed to simultaneously counteract these pathologies by restoring healthy immune function to the brain. Supporting our scientific approach, our Discovery Platform enables us to advance a broad portfolio of product candidates, validated by human genetics, which we believe will improve the probability of technical success over shorter development timelines. As a result, in the last five years, we have identified over forty immune system targets, progressed over ten programs into preclinical research, and advanced two product candidates, AL001 and AL002, into clinical development. In the first quarter of 2019, the dosing of the single ascending dose Phase 1a study in healthy subjects was completed for AL001, initially aimed at treating a subset of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients who have a known genetic mutation that causes a deficiency in progranulin (PGRN), which is called FTD-GRN. Moreover, statistically significant increases in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PGRN levels relative to baseline were also observed, successfully demonstrating proof-of-mechanism for AL001 in the central nervous systems of healthy subjects. We plan to advance AL001 into a Phase 1b study with proof-of-mechanism data in FTD-GRN patients expected in the first half of 2019 and into a Phase 2 study with proof-of-concept data in FTD-GRN patients expected in the first half of 2020. In the second half of 2018, we initiated dosing of healthy subjects in the ascending dose Phase 1a study for AL002, a product candidate for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, in the first half of 2019, we plan to initiate clinical trials with AL003, a product candidate for Alzheimer's disease, in an ascending dose Phase 1a study in healthy subjects. In the second half of 2019, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 study with AL101, a product candidate for multiple neurodegenerative disorders.  Our Discovery Platform leverages large scale human genetic datasets, advanced tools in bioinformatics and imaging, and insights into neurodegeneration and immunology to identify immune system targets that play a critical role in the development of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. We identify mutations in genes that control the brain's immune system, which we believe are the root cause of neurodegeneration, employ a suite of genetic tools to elucidate the immune dysfunction caused by these mutations, and then engineer immune modulating antibodies to counteract the harmful consequences of these genetic mutations.  We are able to identify and employ molecular biomarkers, assays, and precise imaging techniques to confirm target engagement and measure the effect of our product candidates, allowing us to potentially obtain clinical data earlier than would otherwise be expected using traditional clinical measures.  We utilize genetic screening and other biomarkers to better align a patient's specific diagnosis with the targeted intervention in each of our clinical studies.  Our immuno-neurology approach and our Discovery Platform are designed to broadly address multiple neurodegenerative disorders. The breadth of our opportunity is reinforced by our ability to engineer therapeutics capable of modulating a broad array of immune targets, validated by human genetics, across multiple mechanisms of action, including product candidates that activate, block, inhibit, or down-regulate a given target as therapeutically needed. Our intellectual property portfolio covers over 25 patent families, consisting of one approved patent and over 100 pending patent applications directed to over 15 different targets and technologies.  The below table highlights our preclinical and clinical programs.  The above table reflects that we currently have seven neurology programs identified in our research and development pipeline focused on targeting Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and progressive multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we have three oncology programs identified in our research and development pipeline focused on targeting innate immune cells. Currently, we estimate that all of these neurology and oncology focused programs are one to three years or more away from entering preclinical studies assuming that these programs meet our requirements for advancement into the preclinical stage. For each of our programs in our research and development pipeline we are working to identify biomarkers to be utilized in preclinical studies.  Our first program modulates PGRN, a regulator of immune activity in the brain with genetic links to multiple neurodegenerative disorders, including FTD, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 364 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks.  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2017 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates. Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables.	No

To amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and the Head Start Act to promote child care and early learning, and for other purposes.	"Child Care for Working Families Act

This bill provides funds and otherwise revises certain child care and early learning programs for low- to moderate-income families.

Specifically, the bill provides funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant program and reestablishes it as a child care and development assistance program. It also allocates program funds for states to provide services and support to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities.

Further, it revises the program to require each state to, among other things

 create a tiered and transparent system for measuring the quality of child care providers, which must include evidence-based standards and payment rates that are based on a certain cost estimation model; assure that copayments are based on a sliding scale and that no family receiving assistance pays more than 7% of their household income on child care; and use quality child care amounts for certain activities, such as improving the supply of child care providers who provide care to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities (e.g., professional development). It also provides funds and establishes grants for states to create preschool programs for low- to moderate-income children between the ages of three and five years.

Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services must make grants to Head Start agencies to (1) provide children with access to full-school-year and full-school-day services, (2) provide access to additional service hours for migrant and seasonal agencies, or (3) enhance the quality of existing services."	Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics for patients based on hypoxia-inducible factor, or HIF, biology, and building our pipeline while leveraging our development and commercial expertise in renal disease. HIF is the primary regulator of the production of red blood cells, or RBCs, in the body, as well as other important metabolic functions. Pharmacologic modulation of the HIF pathway may have broad therapeutic applications. Our lead product candidate, vadadustat, is an oral therapy in Phase 3 development and has the potential to set a new standard of care in the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease, or CKD. Our management team has extensive experience in developing and commercializing drugs for the treatment of renal and metabolic disorders, as well as a deep understanding of HIF biology. This unique combination of HIF and renal expertise is enabling us to advance a pipeline of HIF-based therapies to potentially address serious diseases.  HIF, a pathway involving hundreds of genes, is the same pathway used by the body to adapt to lower oxygen availability, or hypoxia, such as that experienced with a moderate increase in altitude. At higher altitudes, the body responds to lower oxygen levels by increasing the availability of HIF, which coordinates the interdependent processes of iron utilization and erythropoietin, or EPO, production to increase RBC production and, ultimately, improve oxygen delivery. The significance of the HIF pathway was recognized by the 2016 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, which honored the three physician-scientists who discovered the HIF pathway and elucidated this primary oxygen sensing mechanism that is essential for survival. HIF protein is constantly being produced under normal oxygen conditions, but is quickly degraded by prolyl hydroxylases, or PH. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-PHs are inhibited, allowing HIF to stimulate erythropoiesis. Our lead product candidate, vadadustat, is a HIF-PH inhibitor, or HIF-PHI, in Phase 3 development for the treatment of anemia due to CKD. Anemia is common in patients with CKD, and its prevalence increases as CKD progresses. Anemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is contained within RBCs and carries oxygen to other parts of the body. If there are too few RBCs or if hemoglobin levels are low, the cells in the body will not get enough oxygen. In patients with CKD, anemia results from inadequate EPO levels, which negatively affect RBC production. In addition, iron, which is essential to RBC production, may be deficient in patients with CKD. Left untreated, anemia significantly accelerates overall deterioration of patient health with increased morbidity and mortality. Based on third party prevalence data and company estimates, approximately 37 million people in the United States have CKD and approximately 5.7 million of these individuals suffer from anemia. Anemia from CKD is currently treated by injectable recombinant human erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or injectable ESAs, such as EPOGEN ® (epoetin alfa) and Aranesp ® Based on publicly available information on ESA sales and market data compiled by a third-party vendor, global sales of injectable ESAs for all uses were estimated to be approximately $7.0 billion in 2016. The vast majority of these sales were for the treatment of anemia due to CKD.  When administered to a patient, injectable ESAs provide supra-physiological levels of exogenous erythropoietin to stimulate production of RBCs. While injectable ESAs can be effective in raising hemoglobin levels, they have the potential to cause significant side effects, and need to be injected subcutaneously or intravenously.	No
A bill to protect the privacy of users of social media and other online platforms.	"Social Media Privacy Protection and Consumer Rights Act of 2019

This bill requires online platform operators to inform a user, prior to a user creating an account or otherwise using the platform, that the user's personal data produced during online behavior will be collected and used by the operator and third parties. The operator must provide a user the option to specify privacy preferences, and an operator may deny certain services or complete access to a user if the user's privacy elections create inoperability in the platform.

The operator must (1) offer a user a copy of the personal data of the user that the operator has processed, free of charge, and in an electronic format; and (2) notify a user within 72 hours of becoming aware that the user's data has been transmitted in violation of the security platform.

A violation of the bill's privacy requirements shall be considered an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may enforce this bill against common carriers regulated by the Federal Communications Commission under the Communications Act of 1934 and nonprofit organizations. Currently, common carriers regulated under that Act are exempt from the FTC's enforcement authority, and nonprofit organizations are subject to FTC enforcement only if they provide substantial economic benefit to their for-profit members.

A state may bring a civil action in federal court regarding such violations."	Adobe, Inc.

With key global aviation rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, UAL has the worlds most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500 flights a day to 338 airports across five continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (Newark), Chicago OHare International Airport (Chicago OHare), The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The 3 hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the worlds largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (Republic), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (CommutAir), ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet), GoJet Airlines (GoJet), Mesa Airlines (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines (SkyWest), Air Wisconsin Airlines (Air Wisconsin), and Trans States Airlines (Trans States) are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (CPAs). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world.

To significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	Aduro BioTech, Inc.	We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	Yes

"LifePoint Health , Inc . a Delaware corporation, acting through its subsidiaries, owns and operates community hospitals, regional health systems, physician practices, outpatient centers, and post-acute facilities . At December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, we operated 71 hospital campuses in 22 states throughout the United States (""U.S."") , having a total of 9,254 licensed beds. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized healthcare services to patients through a network of hospitals and outpatient facilities. Our hospitals typically provide the range of medical and surgical services commonly available in hospitals in non-urban markets. These services include general surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, rehabilitation services, pediatric services, and, in some of our hospitals, specialized services such as open-heart surgery, skilled nursing, psychiatric care and neuro-surgery. In many markets, we also provide outpatient services such as same-day surgery, laboratory, x-ray, respiratory therapy, imaging, sports medicine and lithotripsy. The services provided at any specific hospital depend on factors such as community need for the service, whether physicians necessary to operate the service line safely are members of the medical staff of that hospital, whether the service might be supported by community residents, and any contractual or certificate of need restrictions that exist. Like most hospitals located in non-urban markets, our hospitals do not engage in extensive medical research and medical education programs. However, a number of our hospitals have affiliations with medical schools, including the clinical rotation of medical and pharmacy students, and two of our hospitals own and operate schools of nursing and other allied health professions.  We seek to fulfill our mission of Making Communities Healthier ® by striving to (1) improve the quality and types of healthcare services available in our communities; (2) provide physicians with a positive environment in which to practice medicine, with access to necessary equipment and resources; (3) develop and provide a positive work environment for employees; (4) expand each hospital's role as a community asset; and (5) improve each hospital's financial performance. We expect our hospitals to be the place where patients choose to come for care, where physicians want to practice medicine and where employees want to work.  Growth at our facilities is dependent in part on how successful our hospitals are in their efforts to recruit physicians to their respective medical staffs, whether those physicians are active members of their respective medical staffs over a long period of time and whether and to what extent members of our hospitals' medical staffs admit patients to our hospitals or utilize our outpatient service lines.  We also believe that organic growth is dependent in part on the quality of care provided in our facilities. The quality of healthcare services provided at our hospitals is an increasingly important factor to patients when deciding where to seek care, to physicians when deciding where to practice and to governmen tal and private third party paye rs when determining the reimbursement that is paid to our hospitals. We recognize that, in virtually every case, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS"") core measure scores and other quality measures ascribed to our hospitals, such as Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers & Systems scores, 30-day readmission rates, patient falls and adverse drug events, are impacted by the practice decisions of the physicians on our hospital medical staffs. We are committed to further improving our hospitals ' quality scores through targeted strategies, including increased education and engagement campaigns, clinical decision support tools, subject matter expert facilitation and hospital-specific action plans.  Additionally, in most of our markets, a significant portion of patients who require services available at acute care hospitals leave our markets to receive such care , and patients often prefer to be treated in an outpatien t rather than inpatient setting . We believe this presents an opportunity for growth, and we are working with the hospitals in communities where this phenomenon exists to implement new strategies or enhance existing strategies to attract patients, such as adding new service lines and investing in new technologies. We regularly conduct operating reviews of our hospitals to identify new service lines that allow residents of our communities to receive healthcare services closer to home. When such needed service lines are determined, we focus on recruiting the physicians necessary to operate such service lines appropriately. For example, our hospitals have responded to physician interest in requests for hospitalists by introducing or strengthening hospitalist programs where appropriate. Our hospitals have taken other steps to allow more community residents to receive appropriate care close to home, such as structured efforts to solicit input from medical staff members and to respond promptly to legitimate unmet physician needs for necessary equipment or trained support staff. Additionally, we are focused on outpatient opportunities, such as ambulatory surgery centers, diagnostic and imaging centers, urgent care centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, and freestanding emergency care facilities.  While responsibly managing our operating expenses, we have also made significant, targeted investments in our facilities to add new technologies, modernize facilities and expand the services available."

We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel services and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed primarily to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flight arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us.  Most recently, and in conjunction with our leisure travel focus, we are developing Sunseeker Resort in Florida, operating a golf course near the resort location, managing a golf course management solution and beginning to open family entertainment centers in cities in our route network.  Below is a brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers: Scheduled service air transportation.  We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency, nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of that date, we were selling travel on 450 routes to 122 cities. We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority 4 boarding, a customer convenience fee, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. The revenue for ancillary air-related products and services is reflected in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, along with scheduled service air transportation revenue.  We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms and ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) for sale to our passengers. The marketing component of revenue related to our co-branded credit card is also accounted for in this category.  We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis.  We may choose to temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft and/or engines. We are also currently leasing spare engines to a third party and may choose to act as lessor temporarily in the future on an opportunistic basis. This line item also includes revenue from our golf course acquired in 2018 and our management solution to golf courses around the country.  We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the significant costs associated with serving a wide variety of customers and to concentrate our product appeal on a customer base which is under-served by traditional airlines. Unbundled pricing of air-related services and products By unbundling our air-related services and products such as baggage fees, advance seat assignments, travel protection, change fees, priority boarding, and food and beverage purchases , we are able to lower our airfares and target leisure travelers who are more concerned with price and the ability to customize their experience with us by only purchasing the additional conveniences they value. We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 405 routes (and currently selling 450 routes) between 99 origination cities and 23 leisure destinations, and serving 42 states and Puerto Rico as of February 15, 2019.

Acceleron Pharma, Inc.	"We are a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta superfamily therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we have generated several innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. We have focused and prioritized our research and development activities within three key therapeutic areas: hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.  Luspatercept, our lead program, and sotatercept, are partnered with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. Luspatercept is an investigational erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell production through a novel mechanism, and is being developed to treat chronic anemia and associated complications in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis. In 2018, we and Celgene announced positive results for two Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept; one for the treatment of patients with lower-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, known as the MEDALIST trial, and another for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, also known as the BELIEVE trial. In the MEDALIST trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence of at least 8 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. In the BELIEVE trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33 percent reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks, from week 13 to week 24, compared to placebo. Results from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials were then presented during plenary and oral sessions, respectively, at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2018, and we expect to submit these results for publication during 2019. ""Best of ASH,"" chosen from among the thousands of meeting abstracts as  ""the biggest breakthroughs from the meeting's scientific presentations. We and Celgene are planning regulatory application submissions for luspatercept in both MDS and beta-thalassemia in the United States in April 2019 and in Europe in the first half of 2019.  In addition to the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept, Celgene is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the BEYOND trial, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in 2020. Celgene has also initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial, the COMMANDS trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients and enrollment is ongoing. Enrollment is also currently ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted by Celgene for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in the second half of 2019. If luspatercept were to receive regulatory approval for each of these indications in the United States and Europe, we believe that there is an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $2 billion across the indications in the BEYOND trial and the luspatercept Phase 3 clinical trials, and an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $1 billion in myelofibrosis. We and Celgene are also evaluating further research of luspatercept for the treatment of anemia in potential new indications that could provide additional sales opportunities.  For sotatercept, we have the rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, which we refer to as the PH field, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. We are currently enrolling the PULSAR Phase 2 clinical trial of sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH with preliminary results expected in the first half of 2020, and we recently initiated an exploratory study, called SPECTRA, in the first quarter of 2019 to provide us with further understanding of sotatercept's impact on PAH. If sotatercept is commercialized to treat PAH and we recognize such revenue, then Celgene will be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales. For luspatercept and, outside of the PH field, sotatercept, Celgene is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials. ACE-083 is designed for the treatment of focal muscle disorders, and we are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, as well as in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT."

"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	No

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to protect the confidentiality of substance use disorder patient records.	"Protecting Jessica Grubb's Legacy Act

This bill more closely aligns the federal privacy standards for substance use disorder (SUD) patient records with the standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Specifically, the bill authorizes the disclosure of SUD patient records without a patient's written consent to: (1) a covered entity for the purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations, as long as the disclosure is made in accordance with HIPAA; and (2) a public health authority, as long as the content of the disclosure meets HIPAA standards regarding de-identified information. Current law authorizes disclosure of SUD patient records without a patient's written consent only to medical personnel in a medical emergency, to specified personnel for research or program evaluations, or pursuant to a court order.

(""Accelerate"") is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the fast diagnosis of serious infections. Microbiology laboratories are in need of new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the ""CDC"") calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of our time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise of resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by a lack of timely diagnostic results. The delay of identification and antibiotic susceptibility results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories on traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to complete. Our technology platform is built to address these challenges by delivering significantly faster testing of infectious pathogens in various patient sample types.  Our first system to address these challenges is the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Accelerate Pheno™ system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID) infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial and fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antimicrobial. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, which is the first test kit for the system, provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. This information is used to rapidly modify antibiotic therapy to lessen side-affects, improve clinical outcomes, and help preserve the useful life of antibiotics.

In 2017, we began selling the Accelerate Pheno™ system in hospitals in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Consistent with the Company's ""razor"" / ""razor-blade"" business model, revenues to date have principally been generated from the sale of the instruments and the sale of single use consumable test kits.  From 2001 to 2012, we focused primarily upon furthering the research and development of the OpTest portfolio of technologies (""OpTest"") that we acquired from DDx, Inc. in 2001 and the development of revenue producing products related to that technology. The purchase of OpTest provided us with a proprietary surface chemistry formulation, which led to our OptiChem and other surface chemistry products, and quantitative bio-analytical measurement instruments.  In 2012, our Board of Directors and management team established a new strategic direction for the Company, which was (1) to focus on the internal development, manufacture, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and (2) to discontinue efforts to develop and actively market OptiChem and our other surface chemistry products. Since the adoption of the new strategic direction in 2012, we have made significant investments in research and development personnel, facilities, equipment, and consumables to support the internal development of the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Company has also invested in the hiring of regulatory, manufacturing, quality, sales, and marketing personnel experienced in the manufacture and commercialization of medical devices.  This strategic direction required the Company to raise additional capital, including through the following transactions: 4  In August 2013, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $20.0 million.  This strategic direction coupled with various investments permitted the development, clinical trial and FDA registration, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit. Accelerate has expanded the strategic direction it took in 2012 to include the development of additional test kits, systems, and geographic expansion to advance its mission to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections globally.  Antibiotic resistance poses a significant impact to healthcare, costing the U.S. an estimated $55 billion per year in healthcare and productivity costs.

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	No

Public Storage	"could adversely impact our operations or our business , customer, and employee relationships or result in fraudulent payments;  risks associated with the self-insurance of certain business risks, including property and casualty insurance, employee health insurance and workers compensation liabilities;  difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost;  delays and cost overruns on our projects to develop or expand our facilities;  ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions that may divert management's time and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business; and  economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism.  We acquire, develop, own and operate self-storage facilities, which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. At December 31, 2019, we have direct and indirect equity interests in 2,483 self-storage facilities that we consolidate (an aggregate of 169 million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the ""Public Storage"" brand name.  (ii) Ancillary Operations : We reinsure policies against losses to goods stored by customers in our self-storage facilities and sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes, at our self-storage facilities.  Inc. (""PSB""), a publicly held REIT that owns, operates, acquires and develops commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant flex, office, and industrial parks. At December 31, 2019, PSB owns and operates 27.6 million rentable square feet of commercial space.  We have a 35% equity interest in Shurgard Self Storage SA (""Shurgard""), a public company traded on Euronext Brussels under the ""SHUR"" symbol, which owns 234 self-storage facilities (13 million net rentable square feet) located in seven countries in Western Europe operated under the ""Shurgard"" brand name. We believe Shurgard is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  In order to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand, in 2018 we began an effort to expand the number of facilities we manage, through a dedicated internal sales, administration, and implementation team. At December 31, 2019, we are under contract to manage 27 additional facilities, currently under construction, following their completion. We also own 0.9 million net rentable square feet of commercial space which is managed primarily by PSB.  For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.  We believe that our customers generally store their goods within a three to five mile radius of their home or business. Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours, including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours. As a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets where we operate, due to the favorable economics of developing new properties. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Miami, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7% of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 16%, with the remaining 84% owned by regional and local operators.  The high level of ownership fragmentation in the industry is partially attributable to the relative simplicity of managing a local self-storage facility, such that small-scale owners can operate self-storage facilities at a basic level of profitability without significant managerial or operational infrastructure. However, we believe that the economies of scale inherent in this business result in our being able to operate self-storage facilities at a materially higher level 6 of cash flow per square foot than other operators without our scale."

This bill waives, for individuals diagnosed with Huntington's Disease, the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage. Current law generally applies this waiting period to individuals deemed eligible for Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits."	Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"At Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we seek to redefine the treatment experience for patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases. Our vision is grand, our goal bold: to create and commercialize a new generation of medicines intended to lessen the burden of disease on patients, caregivers and society. With a new commercial medicine and robust pipeline of investigational programs focused on meaningfully differentiated treatment options for patients, we believe we are well on our way. Our therapeutic targets include a broad range of neurologic diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.  Our treatment innovations stem from a deep scientific understanding of time-dependent biology – the deliberate mapping of disease patterns and drug activity – along with a goal to meaningfully increase the efficacy of known molecules without compromising tolerability. This approach is designed to ensure that our medicines fit within, rather than define, people's daily lives. Our goal is to develop medicines that are timed for the benefit of patients.  Our understanding of time-dependent biological processes informs our every innovation, targeting advancement in treatment of chronic neurologic disorders.

For example, GOCOVRI is protected by seven-year orphan drug exclusivity, three-year new product exclusivity, and issued patents and pending patent applications out to at least 2035.  We also received $160.0 million in upfront and milestone payments and $4.1 million in development funding from our partnership with Allergan plc. We estimate that approximately 36 million people in the United States suffer from chronic central nervous system, or CNS, disorders such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, psychosis, depression, and Alzheimer' CNS diseases are frequently treated with multiple medications having different mechanisms of action with the goal of maximizing symptomatic benefits for patients."

ARISTADA ARISTADA (aripiprazole lauroxil) is an extended-release intramuscular injectable suspension approved in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia. ARISTADA is the first of our products to utilize our proprietary LinkeRx technology. ARISTADA is a prodrug; once in the body, ARISTADA is likely converted by enzyme-mediated hydrolysis to N-hydroxymethyl aripiprazole, which is then hydrolyzed to aripiprazole. ARISTADA is the first atypical antipsychotic with once-monthly, once-every-six-weeks and once-every-two-months dosing options to deliver and maintain therapeutic levels of medication in the body. ARISTADA has four dosing options (441 mg, 662 mg, 882 mg and 1064 mg) and is packaged in a ready-to-use, pre-filled product format. ARISTADA 1064 mg, our two-month dosing option, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") in June 2017. We developed ARISTADA and manufacture and commercialize it in the U.S.  Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder. The disease is marked by positive symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) and negative symptoms (depression, blunted emotions and social withdrawal), as well as by disorganized thinking. An estimated 2.4 million Americans over the age of 18 have schizophrenia in a given year, with men and women affected equally. Worldwide, it is estimated that one person in every 100 develops schizophrenia. Studies have demonstrated that as many as 75% of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral medication on a regular basis, which can lead to worsening of symptoms.  VIVITROL VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is a once-monthly, non-narcotic, injectable medication approved in the U.S., Russia and certain countries of the CIS for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. VIVITROL uses our polymer-based microsphere injectable extended-release technology to deliver and maintain therapeutic medication levels in the body through one intramuscular injection every four weeks. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL. What are opioid dependence and alcohol dependence?  Opioid dependence is a serious and chronic brain disease characterized by compulsive, prolonged self-administration of opioid substances that are not used for a medical purpose."	No
A bill to address the high cost of prescription drugs.	"Transparent Drug Pricing Act of 2019

This bill establishes several requirements relating to the prices of prescription drugs.

For example, state Medicaid drug-use review programs must require pharmacists to disclose an individual's out-of-pocket cost for a prescription drug, and the price without health insurance, at the point-of-sale. Additionally, health insurers must publish the co-payment amount for each covered prescription drug prior to the annual open-enrollment period.

The bill also temporarily prohibits the retail list price of drugs and biologics from exceeding the lowest retail list price among Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, or Germany."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to successfully commercialize our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") approved product, Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (""Rhopressa ® Rocklatan TM has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") goal date of March 14, 2019. TM (named Rhokiinsa® and Roclanda TM, respectively, in Europe) for regulatory approval in Europe and Japan and expect to commercialize on our own in Europe and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan, if approved. We are also focused on furthering the development of our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases and expect to have two preclinical implants, AR-1105 and AR-13503, commence clinical trials in 2019. Further, we are screening our owned library of Rho kinase (""ROCK"") inhibitors for indications beyond glaucoma.  Rhopressa® is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned ROCK inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Early indications point to healthcare professionals prescribing Rhopressa® as a concomitant therapy to prostaglandins or non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) medications when additional IOP reduction is desired. We believe Rhopressa® is primarily competing with other non-PGA products, due to its targeting of the diseased trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, its preferred once-daily dosing relative to other currently marketed non-PGA products and its safety profile. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  We launched Rhopressa® in the United States at the end of April 2018. Rhopressa® is now being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rhopressa® through pharmacies across the United States. In the glaucoma market in the United States, approximately half of the dispensed volumes are covered under commercial plans and half under Medicare Part D. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® for approximately 90% of lives covered under commercial plans and approximately 40% of lives covered under Medicare Part D plans. We expect Medicare Part D Tier 2 equivalent coverage to increase to over 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Rocklatan TM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Rocklatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Rocklatan TM, if approved and formulary coverage is obtained, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.  We submitted a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Rocklatan TM to the FDA in May 2018 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the ""FDCA""), which provides for an abbreviated approval pathway, since Rocklatan TM is a fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs in the United States. In July 2018, we announced that the NDA was accepted for review by the FDA and the PDUFA goal date was set for March 14, 2019.  Our strategy also includes developing our business outside the United States, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan."	Yes
To provide for the coverage of medically necessary food and vitamins and individual amino acids for digestive and inherited metabolic disorders under Federal health programs and private health insurance, and for other purposes.	"Medical Nutrition Equity Act of 2019

Align Technology, Inc.	"""Align"") is a global medical device company engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign® clear aligners and iTero® intraoral scanners and services for orthodontics, and restorative and aesthetic dentistry. Align's products are intended primarily for the treatment of malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth and are designed to help dental professionals achieve the clinical outcomes that they expect. We sell the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists (""GPs""), as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons. In addition, we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including non-clinical operations, and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products to assist in the provision of oral health care by a licensed dentist. We received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course. Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals and/or labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013. Scanners and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (""CAD/CAM"") services are primarily sold through our direct sales force and a few distributors in North America, Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries, and through distribution partners in smaller non-core international country markets.  Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the population. Annually, approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor's office. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.  The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic, removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases: Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient's treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a digital scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane (or ""PVS"") impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional's election, x-rays of the patient's dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Align's iTero scanner or a few qualified third-party scanners. See ""Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission. "" More than 63% of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression.  Using propriety software which we do not sell, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan. Attachments are tooth-colored ""buttons"" that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement(s).

Effective management of human capital is a core function for all organizations and requires a significant commitment of resources. In today's increasingly complex business and regulatory environment, organizations are being pressured to manage critical payroll and HCM functions more effectively, automate manual processes and decrease their operating costs.  The tax and regulatory environment in the United States is complex and dynamic. Organizations are subject to a myriad of tax, benefit, workers compensation, healthcare and other rules, regulations and reporting obligations. In addition to U.S. federal taxing and regulatory authorities, there are more than 10,000 state and local tax codes in the United States. Further, federal, state and local government agencies continually enact and amend the rules, regulations and reporting requirements with which organizations must comply.

Through our portfolio of trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users.  As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole.  Given these wide-ranging consumer preferences, our strategy focuses on a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We work to apply a centralized discipline to learnings, by sharing best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, human resources, finance, tax, and others. Enabling dating in a digital world Prior to the proliferation of mobile devices and computers, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography and time. Today, the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions and develop romantic connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas that previously prevented individuals from using technology to help find and develop those connections.  We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including: •  : Dating products provide users access to a large number of like-minded people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet.  : The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of options in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.  : Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around the process of reaching out to new people. : The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.  Depending on a person's circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes:  Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and a higher level of security. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large, 3 active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users.  : Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. : Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can associate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography or intent (for example, casual dating or more serious relationships), users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify.  : Users tend to gravitate towards dating products that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them, such as question-based matching algorithms, location-based features, offline events or search capabilities. User experience is also driven by the type of user interface (for example, swiping versus scrolling), a particular mix of free and paid features, ease of use, privacy and security. Users expect every interaction with a dating product to be seamless and intuitive. 	No

To significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and seeks to commercialize therapeutic antibodies with the potential to meaningfully transform the treatment paradigm in migraine. All of our product candidates were discovered and developed by Alder scientists using our proprietary antibody technology platform coupled with a deliberate approach to design and select candidates with properties that we believe optimize the therapeutic potential for patients and commercial competitiveness.  Eptinezumab is being evaluated in a pivotal trial program for the prevention of migraine, with a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) planned for the second half of 2018. Of that number, approximately 13 million people in the United States are candidates for a migraine prevention therapeutic. Of these candidates for migraine prevention, we estimate that there are between five million to seven million people living with episodic and chronic migraine who are the most highly impacted patients, and they typically experience eight or more migraine days per month. Current preventative migraine treatment options, available in the market today, are challenged by safety, efficacy and tolerability limitations. Epidemiologic studies suggest that approximately 38% of migraineurs would benefit from preventive therapies, but only 11% currently receive them. As a result, we believe there is a significant, unmet need for new treatment and prevention options. Eptinezumab is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody inhibiting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a small protein and a validated target that is understood to drive migraine initiation, maintenance and chronification. Designed to deliver a competitively differentiated approach to migraine prevention, we believe eptinezumab holds the potential to be a transformative therapeutic and meet a profound medical need, changing the migraine prevention treatment paradigm for physicians and patients living with migraine.  Our deliberate approach to engineering and developing eptinezumab is designed to provide a unique clinical profile that, after a single administration via an infusion procedure, provides rapid, effective and sustained migraine prevention. We believe that this clinical profile, as supported by data from our clinical trials, will present a potentially compelling value proposition for patients, physicians, payors and our stakeholders.  Eptinezumab is the only potent and selective anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody in clinical development delivered by infusion. We believe that eptinezumab's design, coupled with the infusion mode of administration, provides the following key benefits:  • High specificity and strong binding for rapid and sustained suppression of CGRP biology; •  Allows for the total dose to be immediately active to inhibit CGRP with 100% bioavailability; and 3  Supervised medication administration has the potential to promote patient adherence while maximizing product control and consistency of delivery .  In our first Phase 3 pivotal trial, PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1) for the prevention of frequent episodic migraine, and our second Phase 3 pivotal trial, PRevention Of Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2) for the prevention of chronic migraine, eptinezumab has demonstrated: 1.  On Day 1 post infusion, the risk of having a migraine was reduced by >50% versus baseline following a single administration 2.  Significant days of migraine freedom attained within 1 month following a single administration  Approximately 1 in 3 patients had a ≥75% reduction in migraine days within 1 month •  More than half of patients had a ≥50% reduction in migraine days within 1 month 3.  Sustained: Migraine free days sustained for 3 months following a single administration  ≥50% and ≥75% reductions in migraine days sustained through 3 months  Average 15-17% of patients had no migraines for months 1 to 3 4.

Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018.

We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.

Acacia Communications, Inc.	Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and reductions in associated costs. By implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry's integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products fall into three product groups: embedded modules, pluggable modules and semiconductors. Our embedded module and pluggable module product groups consist of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 1,200 gigabits per second, or Gbps, for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. Our semiconductor product group consists of our low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and our silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which are either integrated into our embedded and pluggable modules or sold to customers on a standalone basis for integration into internally developed or other merchant modules. We are also developing a 400ZR module that will expand our pluggable module product group, and enable inter-data center transmission capacity of 400 Gbps in the same compact pluggable form factors used for 400G client optics, including QSFP-DD and OSFP. Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers' network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.  Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS, capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance and density, and reduce costs. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.  Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic design and integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.  We sell our products through a direct sales force to leading network equipment manufacturers, network operators and cloud service providers.

Groupon, Inc.	BUSINESS Groupon is a global leader in local commerce, making it easy for people around the world to search and discover great businesses and merchandise. Our vision is to connect local commerce, increasing consumer buying power while driving more business to merchants through price and discovery. We want Groupon to be the destination that consumers check first when they are out and about; the place they start when they are looking to buy just about anything, anywhere, anytime. We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet, Groupon is helping local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services.  Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services, generally at a discount. Consumers access those marketplaces through our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries, and our mobile applications.  Our operations are organized into two segments: North America and International. W e offer goods and services through our online marketplaces in three primary categories: We earn product revenue from direct sales of merchandise inventory through our Goods category. We primarily earn service revenue from transactions in which we earn commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Those transactions generally involve a customer's purchase of a voucher through one of our online marketplaces that can be redeemed with a third-party merchant for specified goods or services (or for discounts on specified goods or services). Service revenue also includes commissions that we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications and from voucherless merchant offerings in which customers earn cash back on their credit card statements when they transact with third-party merchants.  The substantial majority of our service revenue transactions is comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. Our goal is to continue to build marketplaces that our customers rely on to discover and save on amazing things to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. With a mobile-first strategy, we intend to improve the customer experience by continuing to invest in innovative, frictionless products and differentiated local supply coupled with strong national brands. As we build out our marketplaces, we want our customers to have a superior, frictionless experience when they use our product whether finding, booking, buying or redeeming an offer. For merchants, this includes providing capabilities to manage demand for their goods and services and improving their ability to acquire customers. For consumers, this includes easily finding offers and accessing features that augment the overall experience, as well as seamlessly purchasing and redeeming offers.

AHGP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP, ii.  The remaining AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP were canceled and converted into the right to receive 29,188,997 ARLP common units which equaled (i) the product of the number of certain AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP multiplied by 1.4782, minus (ii) 1,322,388 ARLP common units. In addition, ARLP issued 1,322,388 ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for causing SGP to contribute to ARLP its remaining limited partner interest in AHGP, which included AHGP's indirect ownership of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal, resulting in an overall exchange ratio to the Owners of SGP equal to that of the other AHGP unitholders. Upon the issuance of ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for the limited partner interest in AHGP, ARLP became a) the sole limited partner of AHGP and b) through AHGP, the indirect owner of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal.

Allakos, Inc.	"We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing AK002, our wholly owned monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of various eosinophil and mast cell related diseases. AK002 selectively targets both eosinophils and mast cells, white blood cells that are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated eosinophils and mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. AK002 has demonstrated activity in clinical trials. In these trails, AK002 depleted blood eosinophils and improved symptoms in patients with three forms of chronic urticaria (""CU"") and indolent systemic mastocytosis (""ISM""), all mast cell driven diseases. The activity observed in ISM and CU suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002's potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings. We are developing AK002 for the treatment of eosinophilic gastritis (""EG""), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (""EGE""), and eosinophilic esophagitis (""EoE""). In addition, we have or are currently conducting studies in ISM, CU, and severe allergic conjunctivitis (""SAC"") and are evaluating additional indications for future development.  : We are focusing our development efforts on AK002 for the treatment of the diseases shown in bold and are evaluating additional indications for future development.  Despite the knowledge that eosinophils and mast cells drive many pathological conditions, there are no approved therapies that selectively target both eosinophils and mast cells. AK002 binds to Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor found on eosinophils and mast cells, which represents a novel way to selectively deplete or inhibit these important immune cells and thereby resolve inflammation. We believe AK002 is the only Siglec-8 targeting 1 antibody currently in clinical development and has the potential to have advantages over current treatments for the diseases we are pursuing.  AK002 has demonstrated activity in 3 forms of CU and ISM, and additional studies are currently being conducted in EG/EGE and SAC. CU is a group of inflammatory skin diseases characterized by hives and severe itching resulting from the inappropriate activation of mast cells in the skin. In a phase 2 open-label six month multiple dose study of 47 antihistamine refractory patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, cholinergic urticaria or dermatographic urticaria, patients reported high levels of disease control and many patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms while receiving AK002. Importantly, AK002 also produced high levels of response in patients that were refractory to the only approved biologic treatment option, Xolair, suggesting that AK002, if approved, could be the treatment of choice for antihistamine refractory CU patients. ISM is a disorder caused by the release of mast cell derived inflammatory mediators throughout the body resulting in severe symptoms in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, joints, and muscles. In a Phase 1 open-label six month multiple dose study in 11 patients with ISM, patients reported significant improvements in symptoms and improved quality of life measures. suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002's potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial in 51 healthy volunteers, all doses of AK002 resulted in complete depletion of blood eosinophils within one hour after administration. The duration of depletion was dose-dependent, with a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg of AK002 suppressing eosinophils for up to 84 days. Depletion of blood eosinophils was also observed in the AK002 ISM and CU clinical studies.  We are currently testing AK002 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in patients with EG and/or EGE. EG and EGE are severe eosinophilic inflammatory diseases of the stomach and small intestine, respectively."	No
A bill to protect students of institutions of higher education and the taxpayer investment in institutions of higher education by improving oversight and accountability of institutions of higher education, particularly for-profit colleges, improving protections for students and borrowers, and ensuring the integrity of postsecondary education programs, and for other purposes.

We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and commercialization of genetically engineered allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf T cell product candidates that are designed to target and kill cancer cells. Our engineered T cells are allogeneic, meaning they are derived from healthy donors for intended use in any patient, rather than from an individual patient for that patient's use, as in the case of autologous T cells. In collaboration with Servier, we are developing UCART19 and ALLO-501, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates targeting CD19. Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

Alliance Resource Partners LP	"We are a diversified natural resource company that generates income from coal production and oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. We are currently the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States with eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia as well as a coal loading terminal in Indiana. We market our coal production to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users. We have grown historically primarily through expansion of our coal operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in these regions. In addition, we generate royalty income from mineral interests we own in premier oil & gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Anadarko, Permian, Williston and Appalachian basins.  Pursuant to that transaction, which closed on the same date, MGP contributed to ARLP all of its incentive distribution rights (""IDRs"") and its 0.99% managing general partner interest in ARLP in exchange for 56,100,000 ARLP common units and a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP. AHGP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP, ii.  The remaining AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP were canceled and converted into the right to receive 29,188,997 ARLP common units which equaled (i) the product of the number of certain AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP multiplied by 1.4782, minus (ii) 1,322,388 ARLP common units. In addition, ARLP issued 1,322,388 ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for causing SGP to contribute to ARLP its remaining limited partner interest in AHGP, which included AHGP's indirect ownership of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal, resulting in an overall exchange ratio to the Owners of SGP equal to that of the other AHGP unitholders. Upon the issuance of ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for the limited partner interest in AHGP, ARLP became a) the sole limited partner of AHGP and b) through AHGP, the indirect owner of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal.

We produce a diverse range of steam and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers. In 2018, we sold a record 40.4 million tons of coal and produced 40.3 million tons. The coal we sold in 2018 was approximately 28.1% low-sulfur coal, 40.1% medium-sulfur coal and 31.8% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. In 2018, approximately 68.2% of our tons sold were purchased by United States electric utilities and 27.8% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions.

To amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to create a presumption that a disability or death of a Federal employee in fire protection activities caused by any of certain diseases is the result of the performance of such employee's duty, and for other purposes.	"Federal Firefighters Fairness Act of 2019

 This bill provides federal worker's compensation to firefighters who contract certain illnesses as a result of their service.

Specifically, the bill provides that (1) heart disease, lung disease, and specified cancers of federal employees employed in fire protection activities for at least 5 years is presumed to be proximately caused by such employment if the employee is diagnosed with the disease within 10 years of their employment in fire protection activities; and (2) the disability or death of the employee due to such disease is presumed to result from personal injury sustained in the performance of duty. These presumptions also apply to fire protection employees who contract any uncommon infectious disease, such as tuberculosis, hepatitis A, B, or C, or the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

 An employee in fire protection activities is a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, rescue worker, ambulance personnel, or hazardous material worker, who (1) is trained in fire suppression; (2) has the legal authority and responsibility to engage in fire suppression; (3) is engaged in the prevention, control, and extinguishment of fires or response to emergency situations where life, property, or the environment is at risk; and (4) performs such activities as a primary responsibility.

To amend the Social Security Act to establish a Medicare for America health program to provide for comprehensive health coverage for all Americans.	"Medicare for America Act of 2019

This bill establishes several health insurance programs and otherwise modifies certain requirements relating to health care coverage, costs, and services.

In particular, the bill establishes a national health insurance program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) cover specified items and services, including hospital services, prescription drugs, dental services, and home- and community-based long-term care; and (3) be fully implemented in 2023. HHS must also offer a transitional public health option that provides certain minimum coverage through health insurance exchanges in 2021 and 2022.

The bill also makes a series of other changes to health care and tax provisions. For example, the bill (1) allows federal funds to be used for abortions; (2) sunsets a specified tax reform law that, among other things, repealed the penalty for failing to maintain minimum essential health coverage; and (3) prohibits excessive prices for prescription drugs and medical devices, as determined by a newly established federal regulatory board."	Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	Yes

Match Group, Inc.	Match Group, Inc., through its portfolio companies, is a leading provider of dating products available globally. Our portfolio of brands includes Tinder ®, Match ®, OkCupid ®, Hinge ®, Pairs™, PlentyOfFish ®, and OurTime ®, as well as a number of other brands, Through our portfolio companies and their trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users. Our products are available in over 40 languages to our users all over the world.  As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the dating category as a whole.  Given these varying consumer preferences, we have adopted a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We work to apply a centralized discipline to our collection of brands, by sharing best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs, improve user safety, and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, trust and safety, human resources, accounting, finance, and tax. Enabling dating in a digital world Prior to the proliferation of mobile devices and computers, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography, and time. People met through work colleagues, friends and family, in school, at church, or in bars and restaurants. Today, the adoption of mobile technology and the internet has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions, and develop romantic connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas across the world that previously prevented individuals from using technology to help find and develop those connections.  We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including: •Expanded options: Dating products provide users access to a large number of people •Efficiency: The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of options in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.  Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around the process of reaching out to new people. •Convenience: The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.  Depending on a person's circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes: •Brand recognition: Brand is very important. Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and a higher level of safety and security. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large, active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology, and awareness of successful usage among similar users.  •Successful experiences: Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. : Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can associate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography, or intent, users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify.  : Users tend to gravitate towards dating products that offer features and user experiences that resonate with them, such as question-based matching algorithms, location-based features, offline events, or search capabilities.

We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	Yes

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) shall test Medicare coverage of expanded telehealth services, as defined by the bill, in conjunction with existing models that test the use of accountable care organizations, bundled payments, and other coordinated care models under Medicare. The CMS must (1) establish a methodology for determining the amounts of payment for such services, and (2) provide for evaluations of the service model by an independent entity.

The CMS shall expand the application of a service tested under the model if (1) the required evaluation demonstrates that the service either reduced Medicare spending without reducing the quality of care or improved the quality of care without increasing spending, and (2) the Chief Actuary of the CMS certifies that such expansion would reduce net program spending. A service that meets these requirements is defined by the bill as a certified enhanced telehealth service.

Medicare payment for a certified enhanced telehealth service shall equal 80% of the lesser of (1) the actual charge for the service, or (2) the amount determined using the payment methodology established under the test model.

With global airline partners, we provide our guests with a network of more than 900 destinations worldwide. We believe our success depends on our ability to provide safe air transportation, develop relationships with guests by providing exceptional customer service and low fares, and maintain a low cost structure to compete effectively. In 2017 we focused much of our energy on integrating Virgin America. We achieved several milestones, including merging most back office functions, kicking off station co-locations and launching technology that enables our front-line employees to be agile between Alaska and Virgin America applications. In January 2018, Alaska and Virgin America obtained a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), our most significant integration milestone to date. The acquisition of Virgin America positioned us as the fifth largest airline in the U.S., with an unparalleled ability to serve West Coast travelers. To do so, we believe we need to meet our guest's evolving needs through innovation in our onboard offerings and provide unique destinations with better schedules, while retaining the best of both the Alaska and Virgin America brand experiences.

Power and Associates annual survey of customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers for the tenth year in a row. Virgin America was also recognized for excellent service by Conde Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure magazine also for the tenth year in a row. Customer service matters, and we believe the combination of Alaska and Virgin America will only enhance the experience for our guests.  Operationally, Alaska held the No. 1 spot in the Wall Street Journal's  ""Middle Seat"" scorecard for U.S. airlines for four consecutive years and the No. 2 spot for 2017. Although we were not the leader in on-time performance in 2017, we led the industry for on-time performance among major airlines for the previous seven years. We are focused on becoming the industry leader in operational performance once again as we fully integrate Alaska and Virgin America operations and we are off to a great start in 2018. In support of the communities that we serve, we strive to be an industry leader in environmental and community stewardship. Our combined fleet is one of the youngest, most fuel-efficient fleets in North America and we look forward to further enhancements in this area. As a result of our environmental and corporate sustainability leadership, we ranked higher than any other North American airline in this year's Dow Jones Sustainability Index. We are also proud of our community stewardship - Air Group donated $14 million to over 1,300 charitable organizations, and our employees volunteered more than 32,000 hours of community service, focused on youth and education, medical research, and transportation and community outreach in 2017.

Amarin Corp. Plc	Management estimates are derived from publicly available information released by independent industry analysts and third-party sources, as well as data from our internal research, and based on assumptions made by us based on such data and our knowledge of such industry, which we believe to be reasonable. Amarin Corporation plc was originally incorporated in England as a private limited company on March 1, 1989 under the Companies Act 1985, and re-registered in England as a public limited company on March 19, 1993.  Our primary office in the United States is located at 1430 Route 206, Bedminster, NJ 07921, USA. We are a pharmaceutical company with expertise in omega-3 fatty acids and lipid science focused on the commercialization and development of therapeutics to improve cardiovascular, or CV, health.  (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride, or TG, levels in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia. Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. The primary targeted clinical benefit of lowering triglycerides in adult patients with severe (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the FDA-approved MARINE indication of patients with severely high (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels, a patient population of approximately 4 million people in the United States.  Our FDA-approved indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in the approved patient population. In considering this approval, the FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels In August 2015, in addition to our FDA-approved indication, we began promoting Vascepa to healthcare professionals, or HCPs, in the United States for the lowering of triglyceride levels and other lipid and lipoprotein parameters in treatment of the patient population studied in the ANCHOR study (persistent high triglycerides after statin therapy). It is estimated that one in four adults in the United States, or more than 50 million people, have elevated (>150 mg/dL) triglyceride levels. We also educated HCPs with supportive but not conclusive early stage and Japanese cardiovascular outcomes trial research on how the unique active ingredient in Vascepa, icosapent ethyl, might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. This HCP promotion was based on an August 2015 federal court declaration and subsequent settlement with the FDA and U.S. government that we believe permits such promotion under the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. To remain truthful and non-misleading, as part of this promotion we educated HCPs on the continued uncertainty between lowering triglycerides and cardiovascular risk reduction based on the failure of other drugs (fenofibrate and formulations of niacin) to demonstrate incremental cardiovascular benefit from adding a second lipid-altering drug on top of standard of care statin therapy, despite such drugs reducing triglyceride levels and having other favorable effects on lipid and lipoprotein parameters. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have shown a significant relative risk reduction, or RRR, of 25% to 35% in the risk of cardiovascular events with statin therapy, leaving significant persistent residual risk despite the achievement of target LDL-C levels. Worldwide, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, remains the number one killer of men and women. In the United States, CVD leads to one in every three deaths—one death approximately every 38 seconds—with annual treatment cost in excess of $500 billion. There is no FDA-approved therapy for lowering cardiovascular risk beyond therapies which target lowering of LDL-C levels.  REDUCE-IT was a global study of 8,179 statin-treated adults with elevated cardiovascular risk. REDUCE-IT met its primary endpoint demonstrating a 25% relative risk reduction, or RRR, to a high degree of statistical significance (p<0.001), in first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, or MACE, in the intent-to-treat patient population with use of Vascepa 4 grams/day as compared to placebo. Patients who were enrolled in REDUCE-IT needed to have LDL-C between 41-100 mg/dL (median baseline LDL-C75 mg/dL) controlled by statin therapy and various cardiovascular risk factors including persistent elevated triglycerides, or TG, between 135-499 mg/dL (median baseline 216 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention cohort) or be at least age 50 with diabetes mellitus and at least one other CV risk factor (primary prevention cohort). Approximately 59% of the patients had diabetes at baseline, approximately 71% of the patients had established cardiovascular disease at time of enrollment and approximately 29% were primary prevention subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

United Airlines Holdings, Inc.	As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional operations. With key global aviation rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, UAL has the worlds most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500 flights a day to 338 airports across five continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (Newark), Chicago OHare International Airport (Chicago OHare), The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The 3 hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the worlds largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (Republic), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (CommutAir), ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet), GoJet Airlines (GoJet), Mesa Airlines (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines (SkyWest), Air Wisconsin Airlines (Air Wisconsin), and Trans States Airlines (Trans States) are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (CPAs). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2018, Star Alliance carriers served 1,300 airports in 191 countries with 18,400 daily departures.

United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carriers selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul, Cape Air, Eurowings, Great Lakes Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Silver Airways. In addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air partners, United also offers a train-to-plane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark on select city pairs in the northeastern United States.  United also participates in three passenger joint ventures, one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes and one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand. These passenger joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. United has also implemented cargo joint 4 ventures with ANA for transpacific cargo services and continues to implement a cargo joint venture with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services. These cargo joint ventures offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers respective combined networks. 	No

Prologis, Inc.	"Business Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Internal Revenue Code""). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. We operate and evaluate our business on an owned and managed (""O & M"") basis, including properties that we wholly-own and properties that are owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We make decisions based on the property operations, regardless of our ownership interest. Our investment consists of our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata (or ownership) share of the properties owned in ventures.  THE COMPANY Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing and property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategies, we have integrated the properties while adding minimal property management expenses . Our results for 2018 include the DCT port folio from the date of acquisition . At December 31, 2018, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through ventures, in the following regions (dollars in billions, based on gross book value and total expected investment (as defined below) and square feet in millions):  Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of one year after completion or reaching 90% occupancy. Amounts represent our total expected investment (""TEI""), which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs.  Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (""FFO""). We collect rent from our customers through long-term operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs."	No

To authorize the Office on Violence Against Women to improve the handling of crimes of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking by incorporating a trauma-informed approach into the initial response to and investigation of such crimes.	"Abby Honold Act

This bill directs the Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women to make competitive grants to law enforcement agencies and victim services organizations to implement evidence-based, trauma-informed approaches in responding to and investigating domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking."	Acceleron Pharma, Inc.	"We are a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we have generated several innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. We have focused and prioritized our research and development activities within three key therapeutic areas: hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.  Luspatercept, our lead program, and sotatercept, are partnered with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. Luspatercept is an erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell production through a novel mechanism, and is being developed to treat chronic anemia and associated complications in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis. Celgene is currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept; one for the treatment of patients with lower-risk MDS, known as the ""MEDALIST"" trial, and another for the treatment of patients with beta-thalassemia, also known as the ""BELIEVE"" trial. Celgene has recently initiated a Phase 2 trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the ""BEYOND"" trial. We further expect Celgene to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial, the ""COMMANDS"" trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients in the first half of 2018. Enrollment is also currently ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder. If luspatercept were to receive regulatory approval for each of these indications in the United States and Europe, we believe that there is an aggregate sales opportunity for this product in excess of $2 billion.  For sotatercept, we announced in September 2017 that Celgene granted us the rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. If sotatercept is commercialized to treat PAH and we recognize such revenue, then Celgene will be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with PAH in the first half of 2018.  For luspatercept and, outside of pulmonary hypertension, sotatercept, Celgene is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials. ACE-083 is designed for the treatment of focal muscle disorders, and we are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, or FSHD, as well as in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT. In January 2018, we announced preliminary results for the first two cohorts in part 1 of the Phase 2 clinical trial with ACE-083 in patients with FSHD showing marked increases in the mean total muscle volume of the muscles treated with ACE-083 measured using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI. We expect to initiate part 2 of the ACE-083 FSHD Phase 2 trial during the second quarter of this year, and we expect to report preliminary results from all dose-escalation cohorts of part 1 in our FSHD and CMT Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in the second half of this year.  In addition to our mid- to late-stage clinical programs, we initiated a Phase 1 healthy volunteer study in early 2018 with ACE-2494, our wholly-owned systemic muscle agent from our proprietary platform technology, IntelliTrap™, and we expect to report initial results from this healthy volunteer study in the first half of 2019. We are also conducting research within our three focused disease areas—hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary—in order to identify new therapeutic candidates to advance into clinical trials.  As of December 31, 2017 our operations have been funded primarily by $105.1 million in equity investments from venture investors, $539.7 million from public investors, $123.7 million in equity investments from our collaboration partners and $273.7 million in upfront payments, milestones, and net research and development payments from our collaboration partners. Announce MEDALIST Phase 3 clinical trial top-line results in mid-2018.  Initiate the COMMANDS Phase 3 clinical trial in the first half of 2018. "	No

Alta Mesa Resources Inc	We were originally formed in November 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of 15,133,333 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to Silver Run Sponsor II, LLC (the Sponsor) generating gross proceeds to us of $22,700,000. A total of $1.035 billion (including approximately $36.2 million in deferred underwriting commissions to the underwriters of the IPO), which represents $1.0143 billion of the proceeds from the IPO after deducting upfront underwriting commissions of $20.7 million, and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account (the Trust Account) to be used to fund an initial business combination. · SRII Opco distributed to the Kingfisher Contributor cash in the amount of approximately $814.8 million in partial payment for the ownership interests in Kingfisher contributed by the Kingfisher Contributor; and · SRII Opco entered into a voting agreement with the owners of the remaining 10% voting interests in Alta Mesa GP whereby such other owners agreed to vote their interests in Alta Mesa GP as directed by SRII Opco.  Following the completion of the Business Combination, the size of our board of directors was expanded from four directors to 11, including one director appointed by Bayou City and its affiliates, one director appointed by HPS and its affiliates and two directors appointed by AM Management and its affiliates, as the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and three directors appointed by the Riverstone Contributor and its affiliates, as the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock. Founded in 1987, Alta Mesa, the predecessor to our E & P Business, was an independent exploration and production company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.  Our Midstream Business was started by Kingfisher on January 30, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating midstream oil and gas assets. We primarily focus on providing crude oil gathering, gas gathering and processing and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate in the STACK play. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 308 miles of existing low and high pressure pipelines, a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, 10 MMcf/d in offtake processing, compression facilities, crude storage, NGL storage and purchasing and marketing capabilities.  Our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling and gas gathering in the STACK.  As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five years, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).

We are preparing for our launch of commercial sales of Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018. After the adoption of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion, we expect a final decision regarding the MAA from the European Commission before the end of 2019. We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.

We began mining operations in 1971 and, since then, have grown through acquisitions and internal development to become the second-largest coal producer in the eastern U.S. In 2017, we sold 37.8 million tons of coal and produced 37.6 million tons of coal, of which 25.4% was low-sulfur coal, 39.9% was medium-sulfur coal and 34.7% was high-sulfur coal. In 2017, we sold 80.0% of our total tons to electric utilities, of which 100% was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These devices, also known as scrubbers, eliminate substantially all emissions of sulfur dioxide. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.  We operate eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia. We also operate a coal loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana. In addition, we own equity interests in various oil and gas mineral interests and gas compression services in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental U.S. Our mining activities are conducted in two geographic regions commonly referred to in the coal industry as the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions. We have grown historically primarily through expansion of our operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in these regions.  AHGP is a Delaware limited partnership that was formed to become the owner and controlling member of MGP. We produce a diverse range of steam and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers.

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

Alliance Resource Partners LP	"We are a diversified natural resource company that generates income from coal production and oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. We are currently the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States with eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia as well as a coal loading terminal in Indiana. We market our coal production to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users. We have grown historically primarily through expansion of our coal operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in these regions. In addition, we generate royalty income from mineral interests we own in premier oil & gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Anadarko, Permian, Williston and Appalachian basins.  Pursuant to that transaction, which closed on the same date, MGP contributed to ARLP all of its incentive distribution rights (""IDRs"") and its 0.99% managing general partner interest in ARLP in exchange for 56,100,000 ARLP common units and a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP. AHGP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP, ii.  The remaining AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP were canceled and converted into the right to receive 29,188,997 ARLP common units which equaled (i) the product of the number of certain AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP multiplied by 1.4782, minus (ii) 1,322,388 ARLP common units. In addition, ARLP issued 1,322,388 ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for causing SGP to contribute to ARLP its remaining limited partner interest in AHGP, which included AHGP's indirect ownership of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal, resulting in an overall exchange ratio to the Owners of SGP equal to that of the other AHGP unitholders. Upon the issuance of ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for the limited partner interest in AHGP, ARLP became a) the sole limited partner of AHGP and b) through AHGP, the indirect owner of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal.  ARLP indirectly owns a 96.0% non-managing member interest and a non-economic managing member interest in Cavalier Minerals.

We produce a diverse range of steam and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers. In 2018, we sold a record 40.4 million tons of coal and produced 40.3 million tons. The coal we sold in 2018 was approximately 28.1% low-sulfur coal, 40.1% medium-sulfur coal and 31.8% high-sulfur coal. Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%. In 2018, approximately 68.2% of our tons sold were purchased by United States electric utilities and 27.8% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions.

HCP, Inc.	"Business General Overview HCP, an S & P 500 company, invests primarily in real estate serving the healthcare industry in the United States (""U.S.""). We are a Maryland corporation organized in 1985 and qualify as a self-administered real estate investment trust (""REIT""). Our diverse portfolio is comprised of investments in the following reportable healthcare segments: (i) senior housing triple-net, (ii) senior housing operating portfolio (""SHOP""), (iii) life science and (iv) medical office. The Spin-Off included 338 properties, primarily comprised of the HCR ManorCare, direct financing lease (""DFL"") investments and an equity investment in HCRMC. QCP is an independent, publicly-traded, self-managed and self-administrated REIT. We invest and manage our real estate portfolio for the long-term to maximize the benefit to our stockholders and support the growth of our dividends. The core elements of our strategy are: (i) to acquire, develop, lease, own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments including senior housing, medical office, and life science, among others; (ii) to align ourselves with leading healthcare companies, operators and service providers which, over the long-term, should result in higher relative rental rates, net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values; and (iii) to maintain an investment grade balance sheet with adequate liquidity and long-term fixed rate debt financing with staggered maturities, which supports the longer-term nature of our investments, while reducing our exposure to interest rate volatility and refinancing risk at any point in the interest rate or credit cycles.  Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to: (i) work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs; and (ii) provide high-quality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew, expand or relocate into our properties.  Build and maintain long-term leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators. In choosing locations for our properties, we focus on their physical environment, adjacency to established businesses (e.g., hospital systems) and educational centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors.  Replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location, design and maintenance of our properties, together with our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio.  We structure lease extensions, early renewals or modifications, which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the re-investment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants' purchase options, while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a long-term basis.  The delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the: (i) compelling long-term demographics driving the demand for healthcare services; (ii) specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and (iii) ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.  While we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership, we may also provide real estate secured financing to, or invest in equity or debt securities of, healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership. We monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment vehicle or geographic location, the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator, or loans that may be made to a single borrower. In allocating capital, we target opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for our portfolio as a whole. We may take additional measures to mitigate risk, including diversifying our investments (by sector, geography, tenant or operator), structuring transactions as master leases, requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications, and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.  our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems, investment banks and other market intermediaries, corporations, private equity firms, non-profits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities;  our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality healthcare real estate; • our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently, which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas; •  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries; and • our control of sites (including assets under contract with radius restrictions).

Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.	"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	Yes

Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and commercialization of genetically engineered allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf T cell product candidates that are designed to target and kill cancer cells. Our engineered T cells are allogeneic, meaning they are derived from healthy donors for intended use in any patient, rather than from an individual patient for that patient's use, as in the case of autologous T cells. In collaboration with Servier, we are developing UCART19 and ALLO-501, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates targeting CD19. Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

A bill to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit anticompetitive behaviors by drug product manufacturers, and for other purposes.	Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 This bill prohibits patent thicketing and product hopping by drug manufacturers. In general, patent thicketing occurs when a drug manufacturer obtains new patents related to a previously-patented drug, biological product, or underlying chemical composition that extends the manufacturer’s market exclusivity for that drug without demonstrating that the new patents serve a meaningful purpose other than limiting competition from generic drug manufacturers. Product hopping is presumed when a drug manufacturer obtains removal of a drug from the Food and Drug Administration’s approved drug list, discontinues a drug, or markets a reformulation of an already-approved drug during a certain period after which the manufacturer has been notified that a competing drug manufacturer has applied for generic drug approval. These practices are not considered product hopping if the manufacturer demonstrates that the drug was removed from the approved-drug list for safety reasons. Or, in the case of a drug reformulation, the manufacturer shows that the modified product provides a significant health benefit, is the option least likely to reduce competition, and is based on substantial financial considerations unrelated to limiting competition. The Federal Trade Commission may penalize violating manufacturers and bring claims in federal court to prohibit the conduct and provide restitution.	Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and commercialization of genetically engineered allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf T cell product candidates that are designed to target and kill cancer cells. Our engineered T cells are allogeneic, meaning they are derived from healthy donors for intended use in any patient, rather than from an individual patient for that patient's use, as in the case of autologous T cells. In collaboration with Servier, we are developing UCART19 and ALLO-501, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates targeting CD19. Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

"Legg Mason, Inc. is a publicly owned asset management holding company. Through its subsidiaries, the firm provides investment management and related services to company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles including pension funds, foundations, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, private banks, family offices, individuals, as well as to global, institutional, and retail clients. It launches and manages equity, fixed income, and multi-asset customized portfolios through its subsidiaries. The firm also launches and manages mutual funds and exchange traded funds for its clients through its subsidiaries. It invests in private and public equity, fixed income, and multi asset markets across the globe through its subsidiaries. Through its subsidiaries, the firm also invests in alternative markets. It also employs a combination of fundamental and quantitative research to make its investments through its subsidiaries. Legg Mason, Inc. was founded in 1899 and is based in Baltimore, Maryland. General Legg Mason is a global asset management firm that operates through nine independent asset management subsidiaries. Acting through our asset management subsidiaries, each of which generally markets its products and services under its own brand name, we provide investment management and related products and services to institutional and individual clients, company-sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles. The predecessor companies to Legg Mason trace back to Legg & Co., a Maryland-based broker-dealer formed in 1899. Our subsequent growth occurred primarily through internal expansion and the acquisition of asset management and broker-dealer firms. In December 2005, Legg Mason completed a transaction in which it sold its primary broker-dealer businesses to concentrate on the asset management industry.  The asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including a shift to lower-fee passively managed products, increased fee pressure (including pressure arising from the shift to lower-fee passive products), regulatory changes, an increasing and changing role of technology in asset management services, the constant introduction of new products and services and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisition. During fiscal year 2018, our focus on investing to improve lives and expanding client choice continued to drive strong sales, despite the ongoing trend of investor movement to passive strategies in certain portions of the industry.  During the course of this fiscal year, we expanded our investment offerings in response to demand for choice by:  offering new next generation products such as multi-asset class solutions and new vehicles, including the launch of six new exchange traded funds (""ETFs"");   completing a bolt-on acquisition adding new capabilities at Clarion Partners;   commercializing alternative products offered by our most recently acquired asset managers; 2   expanding our Alternative Distribution Strategies and Alternative Product teams with strategic hires; and   investing in technology to enhance our capabilities and expand choice for global investors.

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and related products in the United States. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2017, we operated 351 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this market area.  The irrigation industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize long‑term growth rates similar to the pool industry. As irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction, we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant growth opportunities for the irrigation industry.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic, along with relatively consistent annual inflationary price increases of 1% to 2% on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors, has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2016 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool, outdoor living and irrigation products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market. Irrigation activities account for approximately 50% of total spending in the irrigation industry, with the remaining 50% of spending related to power equipment, landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories. Over the last five years, our irrigation business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of single-family home construction as irrigation system installations and landscape projects typically correlate with, but lag, new home construction.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	Aduro BioTech, Inc.	We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	Yes

BUSINESS Groupon is a global leader in local commerce, making it easy for people around the world to search and discover great businesses and merchandise. Our vision is to connect local commerce, increasing consumer buying power while driving more business to merchants through price and discovery. We want Groupon to be the destination that consumers check first when they are out and about; the place they start when they are looking to buy just about anything, anywhere, anytime. We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet, Groupon is helping local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services.  Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services, generally at a discount. Consumers access those marketplaces through our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries, and our mobile applications.  Our operations are organized into two segments: North America and International. W e offer goods and services through our online marketplaces in three primary categories: We earn product revenue from direct sales of merchandise inventory through our Goods category. We primarily earn service revenue from transactions in which we earn commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Those transactions generally involve a customer's purchase of a voucher through one of our online marketplaces that can be redeemed with a third-party merchant for specified goods or services (or for discounts on specified goods or services). Service revenue also includes commissions that we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications and from voucherless merchant offerings in which customers earn cash back on their credit card statements when they transact with third-party merchants.  The substantial majority of our service revenue transactions is comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. Our goal is to continue to build marketplaces that our customers rely on to discover and save on amazing things to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. With a mobile-first strategy, we intend to improve the customer experience by continuing to invest in innovative, frictionless products and differentiated local supply coupled with strong national brands.

Acacia Communications, Inc.	Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and reductions in associated costs. By implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry's integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products fall into three product groups: embedded modules, pluggable modules and semiconductors. Our embedded module and pluggable module product groups consist of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 1,200 gigabits per second, or Gbps, for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. Our semiconductor product group consists of our low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and our silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which are either integrated into our embedded and pluggable modules or sold to customers on a standalone basis for integration into internally developed or other merchant modules. We are also developing a 400ZR module that will expand our pluggable module product group, and enable inter-data center transmission capacity of 400 Gbps in the same compact pluggable form factors used for 400G client optics, including QSFP-DD and OSFP. Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers' network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.  Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS, capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance and density, and reduce costs. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.  Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic design and integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.  We sell our products through a direct sales force to leading network equipment manufacturers, network operators and cloud service providers.

A bill to require the establishment of a process for excluding articles imported from the People's Republic of China from certain duties imposed under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and for other purposes.	"Import Tax Relief Act of 2019

This bill requires the President to establish a process by which certain articles imported from China may be excluded from duties.

Specifically, the bill requires the creation of a process whereby U.S. entities may request that articles imported from China be excluded from duties imposed under the Trade Act of 1974. Such an exclusion must be based on a determination that the article can easily be excluded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and that (1) the article is not commercially available outside of China or produced at a cost-competitive price, (2) a duty on the article would increase consumer prices for everyday items consumed by low- or middle-income families in the United States, or (3) the article does not directly benefit from nonmarket-based policies of China.

Further, this exclusion applies retroactively to recently imported articles that would have been subject to a lower rate under this bill."	United Airlines Holdings, Inc.

The 3 hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the worlds largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (Republic), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (CommutAir), ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet), GoJet Airlines (GoJet), Mesa Airlines (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines (SkyWest), Air Wisconsin Airlines (Air Wisconsin), and Trans States Airlines (Trans States) are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (CPAs). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world.

Adaptimmune Therapeutics Plc	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on providing novel cell therapies to patients, particularly in solid tumors. (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform enables us to identify cancer targets, find and genetically engineer T-cell receptors (TCRs), and produce therapeutic candidates for administration to patients. Using our affinity engineered TCRs, we aim to become a fully integrated cell therapy company and to be the first company to have a TCR T-cell approved for a solid tumor indication.  We have four SPEAR T-cells in clinical trials, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4, AFP and NY-ESO. Phase 1/2 clinical trials are ongoing in patients with various cancer tumor types including urothelial, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, esophageal, gastric, multiple myeloma, hepatocellular cancers and in synovial sarcoma, myxoid round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) and non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Our MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells have shown promising tolerability profiles with no evidence of off-target toxicities observed. The MAGE-A10 triple tumor study dose escalation to 1 billion transduced cells, which is the dose previously observed to provide responses with our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell, has been recommended by the Safety Review Committee (SRC). In the MAGE-A10 NSCLC study, the SRC has recommended modification of the protocol to permit escalation of the patient dose to 1 billion transduced cells with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide preconditioning in the next treatment cohort. In the MAGE-A4 trial patient enrollment has started in bladder, melanoma, head and neck, ovarian, NSCLC, esophageal and gastric cancers.  Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell has shown promising initial results in clinical trials with a 50% response rate and a median projected overall survival of 120 weeks (~28 months) in Cohort 1 of synovial sarcoma (a solid tumor) and 76% overall response rate at day 100 in multiple myeloma. We have also now seen three partial responses (two confirmed and one to be confirmed) and one stable disease in the first four patients dosed in a second solid tumor indication, MRCLS. Our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy has breakthrough therapy designation in the United States and has also received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and European Commission for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also granted PRIME regulatory access for our NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy for the synovial sarcoma indication.  In September 2017, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) exercised its option to obtain an exclusive global license to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell program. Upon transition of the NY-ESO program to GSK which is anticipated to occur during 2018, GSK will assume full responsibility for all development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell including progression of the SPEAR T-cell into further clinical trials.  In January 2018, we announced that we had successfully manufactured the first SPEAR T-cells for a patient at our Navy Yard facility in Philadelphia. We intend to use the facility to manufacture SPEAR T-cells for all three of our wholly owned programs. In addition in January 2018 we also announced an agreement with Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult for vector production in the U.K., which is intended to ensure vector supply for our ongoing and future clinical studies.  Our SPEAR T-cell platform is being utilized with the aim of maximizing both patient and disease indication coverage in a number of different ways.  · We are using our platform to identify and validate cancer targets for development of SPEAR T-cells in multiple indications. As a result, we are developing multiple SPEAR T-cells to different target antigens within selected disease indications to increase treatment potential for any given disease. For example the NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A4 and MAGE-A10 SPEAR T-cells address targets expressed in NSCLC, melanoma, urothelial (bladder) cancers and head and neck cancers, with each of these indications being addressed by at least two of the SPEAR T-cells.  · We are also developing SPEAR T-cells directed to targets which are closely related to a specific disease indication. Further targets closely associated with other cancers are also being validated.  1 · Finally, we are identifying peptides to different Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types ensuring that for any given target, for example NY-ESO, MAGE-A10, MAGE-A4 or AFP, we can address patient populations with different HLA types.

Acacia Communications, Inc.	Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and reductions in associated costs. By converting optical interconnect technology to a silicon-based technology, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry's integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products include a family of low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which we have integrated into families of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 400 gigabits per second, or Gbps, for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. We are also developing our AC1200 module that will enable, across dual wavelengths, transmission capacity of 1.2 terabits per second (1,200 Gbps). Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers' network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.  Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to continue to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS and capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance, density and cost. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.  Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic design and integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.

Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing drugs to treat patients with serious cardiometabolic diseases caused by lipid disorders. Our goal is to become the premier company offering treatments for these inadequately treated diseases. We are advancing a mature pipeline of four novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. Our most advanced drug, volanesorsen, is currently under review by regulatory agencies in the United States, or U.S., European Union, or EU, and Canada for the treatment of people with familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of August 30, 2018 and scheduled advisory committee meeting for May 10, 2018. In Canada, our New Drug Submission, or NDS, was granted Priority Review by Health Canada. FCS is a severe, rare, genetically defined lipid disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels of triglycerides. FCS has life-threatening consequences such as acute pancreatitis and the lives of patients with these diseases are impacted daily by the associated symptoms. In our clinical program, we have observed consistent and substantial (>70%) decreases in triglycerides and improvements in other manifestations of FCS, including pancreatitis attacks and abdominal pain. We believe the safety and efficacy data from the volanesorsen program demonstrate a favorable risk-benefit profile for patients with FCS. We are preparing for approval and launch of volanesorsen in mid-2018. Volanesorsen is also in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of familial partial lipodystrophy, or FPL. Our other three drugs are currently in Phase 2 clinical development.  We have made substantial progress in assembling the infrastructure to commercialize our drugs globally for rare disease indications with an initial focus on lipid specialists as the primary call point. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed lipid disorders will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these patients. In the future, this global infrastructure may support commercialization of additional drugs within and outside the cardiometabolic arena.  To maximize the commercial potential of two of the drugs in our pipeline, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, for the development and commercialization of AKCEA-APO(a)-L  We believe Novartis brings significant resources and expertise to the collaboration that can accelerate our ability to deliver these potential therapies to the large populations of patients who have high cardiovascular risk due to inadequately treated lipid disorders. Rx (data planned for 2019), and if, on a drug-by-drug basis, Novartis exercises its option to license a drug and pays us the $150.0 million license fee to do so, Novartis would conduct and pay for a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcome study in high-risk patients and, if approved, commercialize each such licensed drug worldwide. We plan to co-commercialize any licensed drug commercialized by Novartis in selected markets, under terms and conditions that we plan to negotiate with Novartis in the future, through the specialized sales force we are building to commercialize volanesorsen. Overall, we are eligible to receive license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of each drug Novartis licenses if and when it meets the development, regulatory and sales milestones specified in our agreement. Cardiometabolic disease, which includes cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases, is the number one cause of death globally. According to the American Heart Association, or AHA, cardiovascular disease, or CVD, alone accounts for 17.3 million deaths per year globally, a number that the AHA expects to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030. Further, between 2010 and 2030, total direct medical costs of CVD in the United States alone are projected to triple from $272.5 billion to $818.1 billion, according to the AHA.	Yes

A bill to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a clinical trial of the effects of cannabis on certain health outcomes of adults with chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder, and for other purposes.	"VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to conduct a clinical trial of the effects of medical-grade cannabis on the health outcomes of covered veterans diagnosed with chronic pain, and also those diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA patient enrollment system for hospital care and medical services."	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

Given the local nature of our business, we locate our facilities in close proximity to our key customers and often co-locate multiple operations in one facility to increase customer service and efficiency.  45 metropolitan areas in 19 states that includes a mix of large-scale production homebuilders, custom homebuilders, multi-family builders and professional repair and remodeling contractors. Our largest 10 customers accounted for approximately 21% of our 2018 net sales, with no single customer accounting for more than 6% of our 2018 net sales. Our largest customers comprise primarily large production homebuilders, including publicly traded companies such as D.R. Horton, Inc., Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., Lennar Corporation, PulteGroup, Inc., Toll Brothers, Inc. and TRI Pointe Group, Inc. In addition to these large production homebuilders, we also service and supply regional and local custom homebuilders. We also serve professional residential remodeling contractors and multi-family and light commercial contractors in most of our markets.  Our Products and Services We provide a wide variety of building products and services directly to homebuilder and professional contractor customers. We offer a broad range of products sourced through a network of suppliers with whom we have strategic supplier agreements. These products are available through our distribution locations and eCommerce platform and, in most instances, are delivered to the job site. We manufacture floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels, stairs, specialty millwork, windows and pre-hung doors. We have developed several proprietary capabilities to design, pre-cut, label and bundle lumber and lumber sheet goods into customized framing packages, which we have branded Ready-Frame ®.  We also provide an extensive range of installation services and special order products.  We group our building products and services into four product categories: (i) structural components, (ii) lumber and lumber sheet goods, (iii) millwork, doors and windows, and (iv) other building products and services. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , our sales of structural components and millwork, doors and windows products represented 43% of net sales. Each of these categories includes both manufactured and distributed products. Products in these categories typically carry a higher gross margin than lumber and lumber sheet goods and other building products and services, and provide us with opportunities to cross-sell other products and services. Structural components are factory-built substitutes for job-site framing and include floor trusses, roof trusses, wall panels and EWP that in many cases we design and cut for each home. Roof trusses, floor trusses and wall panels are built in a factory controlled environment."	No
A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a public health insurance option, and for other purposes.	Consumer Health Options and Insurance Competition Enhancement Act or the CHOICE Act This bill requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop a public health insurance option that meets all federal plan requirements and is available on state and federal health insurance exchanges. Specifically, the CMS must offer silver and gold plans, may offer bronze plans, and must include all essential benefits, consumer protections, and cost-sharing limitations in each plan. The CMS may contract with a third party to administer the public option plans and states may establish advisory councils to make recommendations to the CMS about the operation and policies of such plans. Further, the CMS must establish geographically adjusted premiums and negotiate provider payment rates for services and prescription drugs covered the plans. If a payment rate cannot be negotiated, the CMS must pay the amount for such service as required under traditional Medicare. Medicare and Medicaid providers are automatically participants in public option plans unless they opt out, and providers not participating in Medicare or Medicaid may opt in.	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 with the recommended dosing of 34 mg once a day taken as two 17 mg tablets. In June 2018, the FDA approved a 34 mg NUPLAZID capsule formulation that provides patients with the recommended 34 mg once daily dose in a single, small capsule, reducing patient pill burden compared to the previous administration of two 17 mg tablets. In addition, the FDA approved a 10 mg NUPLAZID tablet for patients concomitantly receiving strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, which can inhibit the metabolizing of NUPLAZID .  We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we are continuing to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis is one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we 1 announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 s tudy exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency , we initiated our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementi Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, major depressive disorder, or MDD, affects approximately 16 million adults in the United States, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy. In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in 207 patients with MDD who had a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line, SSRI or SNRI, antidepressant therapy. In the study, pimavanserin met the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and positive results were also observed in seven additional secondary endpoints including response rate, improvement in sexual function, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness. Pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated in the study with no meaningful weight gain or impact on motor function observed. In February 2019, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program for pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in the first half of 2019.  We also believe schizophrenia is a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address certain important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms.

To intensify stem cell research showing evidence of substantial clinical benefit to patients, and for other purposes.	"Patients First Act of 2019

This bill requires the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to support stem cell research. Specifically, the NIH must conduct and support basic and applied research to develop techniques for the isolation, derivation, production, testing, and human clinical use of stem cells that may result in improved understanding of, or treatments for, diseases and other adverse health conditions. However, such techniques must not involve (1) the creation of a human embryo for research purposes; (2) the destruction or discarding of, or risk of injury to, a human embryo; or (3) the use of any stem cell the derivation or provision of which would be inconsistent with this bill.

The NIH must also report on peer-reviewed stem cell research proposals that were not funded."	Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients'  lives through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic diseases, or RGDs, which are diseases that are directly caused by changes in genes or chromosomes, often passed from one generation to the next. The incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally very infrequent, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000 births. In both areas of cancer and RGDs, we are seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies.  Our first commercial cancer product is IDHIFA®. In August 2017, the FDA granted our collaboration partner Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, approval of IDHIFA® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML, and an IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IDHIFA®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation.  Our most advanced clinical cancer product candidates are ivosidenib, which targets mutated IDH1, and AG-881, which is a brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor. In December 2017, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for ivosidenib for the treatment of patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. We plan to submit an MAA to the EMA for ivosidenib for IDH1 mutant-positive R/R AML in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Our next most advanced cancer product candidate is AG-270, an inhibitor of MAT2A. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AG-270 in November 2017, and in December 2017 the FDA concluded that we may proceed with our planned phase 1 dose-escalation trial of AG-270 in multiple tumor types carrying a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deletion. We expect to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2018.  Our most advanced preclinical cancer product candidate is an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme DHODH. We plan to submit an IND for our DHODH inhibitor for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The lead product candidate in our RGD program, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase, or PK, deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice and lifelong conditions associated with chronic anemia and secondary complications due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells, or RBCs. We intend to initiate two global, pivotal trials of AG-348 in PK deficiency in the first half of 2018: ACTIVATE-T, a single arm trial of approximately 20 regularly transfused patients, is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2018, and ACTIVATE, a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 80 patients who do not receive regular transfusions, is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2018. We also expect to initiate a phase 2 proof of concept trial of AG-348 in thalassemia in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned development programs, we are seeking to advance a number of early-stage discovery programs in the areas of cancer metabolism, RGDs and metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, a developing field which aims to modulate the activity of relevant immune cells by targeting critical metabolic nodes, thereby, enhancing the immune mediated anti-tumor response.  The clinical development strategy for all of our product and development candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our expertise in ""flux biochemistry. This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple networks of metabolic enzymes."

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We market two U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies, including Ampyra (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10mg, a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with multiple sclerosis, or MS, as demonstrated by an increase in walking speed. We have a pipeline of novel neurological therapies addressing a range of disorders, including Parkinson's disease and MS.  We currently derive substantially all our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. In March 2017, we announced a decision by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers upholding our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent set to expire on July 30, 2018, but invalidating our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, we expect to maintain patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra at least through July 30, 2018, depending on the outcome of appeal of the District Court's decision. The defendant generic drug manufacturers have appealed the District Court's decision upholding the patent that expires in July 2018, and we have appealed the ruling on the four invalidated patents. We expect to experience a rapid and significant decline in Ampyra sales beyond July 2018 due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that may be marketed after the expiration of our remaining Ampyra patent, unless the District Court's decision on the four invalidated patents is overturned on appeal, which could include reversal or remand by the appeals court back to the District Court. If the appeals court does not overturn the District Court's decision by July 30, 2018, multiple ANDA filers may be able to launch generic versions of Ampyra absent injunctive relief. Inbrija, our most advanced development program, is a self-administered, inhaled formulation of levodopa, or L-dopa, being investigated for the treatment of OFF periods in people with Parkinson's disease who are taking a carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Inbrija is based on our proprietary ARCUS platform, a dry-powder pulmonary drug delivery technology that we believe has potential applications in multiple disease areas. We announced positive Phase 3 efficacy and safety data for this program in 2017. In June 2017, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija to the FDA. In August 2017, we announced that we received a Refusal to File, or RTF, letter from the FDA regarding the Inbrija NDA. Upon its preliminary review, the FDA determined that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The FDA specified two reasons for the RTF: first, the date when the manufacturing site would be ready for inspection; and second, a question regarding the submission of the drug master production record. The resubmission addressed the two issues raised in the RTF and included all additional information requested by the FDA in the RTF. On February 20, 2018, we announced that the resubmitted NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA, and that under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has set a target date of October 5, 2018. Our commercial preparations for the launch of Inbrija continue. We expect to file a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency in the first quarter of 2018. In November 2017, we discontinued our clinical development program for tozadenant, an investigational treatment for reduction of OFF time in people with Parkinson' We made this decision based on new information obtained from our Phase 3 clinical trials related to agranulocytosis and associated serious adverse events.  In return for the payment to us, HCRP obtained the right to receive Fampyra royalties payable to us by Biogen, up to an agreed upon threshold of royalties. We believe that operating expense reductions from the restructuring, as well as additional expense reductions due to termination of the tozadenant development program, will enable us to fund operations through launch of Inbrija in the U.S., pending approval from the FDA.

A bill to amend the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 to strengthen protections relating to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information of children and minors, and for other purposes.	"This bill extends to minors (ages 12–16) privacy protections previously applicable only to children (ages 0–12) and otherwise establishes greater online privacy protections for children and minors.

Specifically, the bill prohibits an operator of a website, online service, online application, or mobile application directed to a child or minor with constructive knowledge the user is a child or minor from collecting the user's personal information without

 providing notice and obtaining consent, providing a parent or minor with certain information upon request, conditioning participation by a user on the provision of personal information, establishing and maintaining reasonable procedures to protect the personal information collected from users. The bill also prohibits targeted marketing directed to a child or directed to a minor without the minor's consent.

The bill further outlines a set of principles governing how operators should collect and use personal information, as well as provide information to a parent or minor. A parent or minor must be able to challenge the accuracy of personal information, and an operator must provide for the erasure or correction of inaccurate personal information. Operators must also implement mechanisms for the erasure or elimination of personal information at the request of users and make users aware of such mechanisms.

Moreover, the bill prohibits the sale of internet-connected devices targeted to children and minors unless they meet certain cybersecurity and data security standards, and it requires manufacturers of such devices to display a privacy dashboard detailing how personal information is collected and used."

To repeal certain amendments to the Clean Air Act relating to the expansion of the renewable fuel program, and for other purposes.	"Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act or the LEVEL Act 

This bill revises the renewable fuel program, including the renewable fuel standard (RFS). Under current law, the RFS specifies the minimum volume of renewable fuel, such as ethanol, that must be contained in gasoline sold in the United States, except in noncontiguous states or territories. The RFS annually increases until 2022 when a minimum of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel must be blended into gasoline. This bill decreases the volume of renewable fuel that must be contained in gasoline to 7.5 billion gallons each year. The bill also revises the RFS to eliminate separate volume requirements for the following renewable fuel categories: advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel.

Petitions for waivers from requirements under the renewable fuel program may not be brought by a person who is subject to the requirements of the program, nor by the EPA on its own motion.

The EPA may not authorize the sale of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, unless the gasoline was registered under the program and lawfully sold in the United States before this bill's enactment.

The EPA must study the effects of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, including the effects on consumer products, such as nonroad vehicles."	Activision Blizzard, Inc.	"Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (""PC""), and mobile devices. We also operate esports events and leagues and create film and television content based on our games. On February 23, 2016 (the ""King Closing Date""), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company (""King""), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the ""King Acquisition""). We made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly complementary mobile business positioned us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, and aligned us for future growth. Our Strategy and Vision Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.  We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports and film and television content.  Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.  Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental  ""in-game"" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we believe there is an opportunity for advertising within certain of our franchises, as well as opportunities to drive new forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products. As such, commencing with the 3 second quarter of 2017, MLG, which was previously a separate operating segment, is now a component of the Blizzard operating segment. MLG is responsible for the operations of the Overwatch League, along with other esports events, and will also continue to serve as a multi-platform network for other Activision Blizzard esports content.

To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, a cure.	Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.	Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients'  lives through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism and adjacent areas of biology, with the goal of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines for the treatment of cancer and rare genetic diseases, or RGDs. To address both cancer and RGDs, we take a systems biology approach to deeply understand disease states, drive the discovery and validation of novel therapeutic targets, and define patient selection strategies, thereby increasing the probability that our experimental medicines will have the desired therapeutic effect.  In July 2018, the FDA granted us approval of our wholly-owned product, TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib) for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML with a susceptible IDH1 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. TIBSOVO®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH1 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. In December 2018, we submitted an MAA to the EMA for TIBSOVO® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML. Also in December 2018, we submitted a sNDA to the FDA for TIBSOVO® for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed AML with an IDH1 mutation who are not eligible for standard treatment. Our other commercial cancer product is IDHIFA® (enasidenib). In August 2017, the FDA granted our collaboration partner Celgene approval of IDHIFA® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IDHIFA®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation. Celgene has submitted an MAA to the EMA for IDHIFA® for IDH2 mutant-positive AML. Our pre-commercial clinical cancer product candidates are vorasidenib (AG-881), AG-270, and AG-636.  Vorasidenib (AG-881) is a brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor. We expect to initiate a registration-enabling phase 3 study of vorasidenib (AG-881) in low-grade glioma with an IDH1 mutation by the end of 2019.  AG-270 is an orally available selective potent inhibitor of MAT2A. We are currently evaluating AG-270 in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial in multiple tumor types carrying a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deletion, and expect to complete dose escalation and initiate dose expansion arms of this trial in the first half of 2019.  AG-636 is an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme DHODH. In October 2018, we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AG-636 for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, which was accepted by the FDA in November 2018. We expect to initiate a phase 1 dose-escalation trial of AG-636 in lymphoma in the first half of 2019.  The lead product candidate in our RGD portfolio, mitapivat, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase, or PK, deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice and lifelong conditions associated with chronic anemia and secondary complications due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells, or RBCs. In April 2018, we initiated ACTIVATE-T, a single arm, global, pivotal trial of mitapivat in approximately 20 regularly transfused patients with PK deficiency. In June 2018, we initiated ACTIVATE, a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, global, pivotal trial of mitapivat in approximately 80 patients with PK deficiency who do not receive regular transfusions. We also initiated a phase 2 proof of concept trial of mitapivat in thalassemia in December 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned development programs, we are seeking to advance a number of early-stage discovery programs in the areas of cancer metabolism, RGDs and metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, a developing field which aims to modulate the activity of relevant immune cells by targeting critical metabolic nodes, thereby enhancing the immune mediated anti-tumor response.

We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. APO(a)-L Rx , AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx , AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx , are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform. Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.  TEGSEDI is the world's first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea's first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea Connect TM , a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country. Internationally, Akcea Connect is being rolled out in each of the countries where we launch with what we believe is the highest level of patient and physician support allowed in accordance with local regulations. Accredo to be our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Express Scripts' Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo because of their experience supporting the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and over 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass™ in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis.

We also sell consumer and credit information to resellers who combine our information with other information to provide direct to consumer monitoring, reports and scores.  In fiscal 2017, we experienced a cybersecurity incident following a criminal attack on our systems that involved the theft of certain personally identifiable information of U.S., Canadian and U.K. consumers. Criminals exploited a U.S. website application vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to our network. Based on our forensic investigation, the unauthorized access of information occurred from mid-May through July 2017. In addition, credit card numbers for approximately 209,000 U.S. and Canadian consumers, and certain dispute documents with personal identifying information for approximately 182,000 U.S. consumers, were accessed. The investigation determined that personal information 2 of approximately 19,000 Canadian consumers was impacted and approximately 860,000 potentially affected U.K. consumers were contacted regarding access to personal information. No evidence was found that the Company's core consumer, employment and income, or commercial credit reporting databases were accessed.  The Company acted promptly to notify the approximately 145.5 million U.S. consumers whose personally identifiable information the Company had identified in 2017 as potentially accessed. As a result of an ongoing analysis of data stolen in the 2017 cybersecurity incident, the Company recently announced that it was able to identify approximately 2.4 million U.S. consumers whose name and partial driver's license information were stolen, but who were not in the affected population of approximately 145.5 million consumers previously identified by the Company in 2017. The Company has taken and continues to take extensive steps designed to prevent this type of incident from happening again and to earn back the trust of consumers, customers and regulators.  Upon discovery of the unauthorized access, we acted immediately to stop the intrusion and promptly engaged a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the scope of the intrusion, including the specific data potentially impacted.

Allegiant Travel Co.	Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding future expense, capacity growth, expected capital expenditures, number of contracted aircraft to be placed in service in the future, future expansion of our golf management and family entertainment center businesses, the development and financing of our Sunseeker Resort, as well as other information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel services and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed primarily to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flight arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us.  Most recently, and in conjunction with our leisure travel focus, we are developing Sunseeker Resort in Florida, operating a golf course near the resort location, managing a golf course management solution and beginning to open family entertainment centers in cities in our route network.  Below is a brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers: Scheduled service air transportation.  We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency, nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of that date, we were selling travel on 450 routes to 122 cities. We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority 4 boarding, a customer convenience fee, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. The revenue for ancillary air-related products and services is reflected in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, along with scheduled service air transportation revenue.  We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms and ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) for sale to our passengers. The marketing component of revenue related to our co-branded credit card is also accounted for in this category.  We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis.  We may choose to temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft and/or engines. We are also currently leasing spare engines to a third party and may choose to act as lessor temporarily in the future on an opportunistic basis. This line item also includes revenue from our golf course acquired in 2018 and our management solution to golf courses around the country.  We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the significant costs associated with serving a wide variety of customers and to concentrate our product appeal on a customer base which is under-served by traditional airlines. Unbundled pricing of air-related services and products By unbundling our air-related services and products such as baggage fees, advance seat assignments, travel protection, change fees, priority boarding, and food and beverage purchases , we are able to lower our airfares and target leisure travelers who are more concerned with price and the ability to customize their experience with us by only purchasing the additional conveniences they value. We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 405 routes (and currently selling 450 routes) between 99 origination cities and 23 leisure destinations, and serving 42 states and Puerto Rico as of February 15, 2019.

To amend the Social Security Act to establish a Medicare for America health program to provide for comprehensive health coverage for all Americans.	"Medicare for America Act of 2019

This bill establishes several health insurance programs and otherwise modifies certain requirements relating to health care coverage, costs, and services.

In particular, the bill establishes a national health insurance program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) cover specified items and services, including hospital services, prescription drugs, dental services, and home- and community-based long-term care; and (3) be fully implemented in 2023. HHS must also offer a transitional public health option that provides certain minimum coverage through health insurance exchanges in 2021 and 2022.

Allakos, Inc.	"We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing AK002, our wholly owned monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of various eosinophil and mast cell related diseases. AK002 selectively targets both eosinophils and mast cells, white blood cells that are widely distributed in the body and play a central role in the inflammatory response. Inappropriately activated eosinophils and mast cells have been identified as key drivers in a number of severe diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, eyes, skin, lungs and other organs. AK002 has demonstrated activity in clinical trials. In these trails, AK002 depleted blood eosinophils and improved symptoms in patients with three forms of chronic urticaria (""CU"") and indolent systemic mastocytosis (""ISM""), all mast cell driven diseases. The activity observed in ISM and CU suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002's potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings. We are developing AK002 for the treatment of eosinophilic gastritis (""EG""), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (""EGE""), and eosinophilic esophagitis (""EoE""). In addition, we have or are currently conducting studies in ISM, CU, and severe allergic conjunctivitis (""SAC"") and are evaluating additional indications for future development.  : We are focusing our development efforts on AK002 for the treatment of the diseases shown in bold and are evaluating additional indications for future development.  Despite the knowledge that eosinophils and mast cells drive many pathological conditions, there are no approved therapies that selectively target both eosinophils and mast cells. AK002 binds to Siglec-8, an inhibitory receptor found on eosinophils and mast cells, which represents a novel way to selectively deplete or inhibit these important immune cells and thereby resolve inflammation. We believe AK002 is the only Siglec-8 targeting 1 antibody currently in clinical development and has the potential to have advantages over current treatments for the diseases we are pursuing.  AK002 has demonstrated activity in 3 forms of CU and ISM, and additional studies are currently being conducted in EG/EGE and SAC. CU is a group of inflammatory skin diseases characterized by hives and severe itching resulting from the inappropriate activation of mast cells in the skin. In a phase 2 open-label six month multiple dose study of 47 antihistamine refractory patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria, cholinergic urticaria or dermatographic urticaria, patients reported high levels of disease control and many patients experienced complete resolution of symptoms while receiving AK002. Importantly, AK002 also produced high levels of response in patients that were refractory to the only approved biologic treatment option, Xolair, suggesting that AK002, if approved, could be the treatment of choice for antihistamine refractory CU patients. ISM is a disorder caused by the release of mast cell derived inflammatory mediators throughout the body resulting in severe symptoms in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, joints, and muscles. In a Phase 1 open-label six month multiple dose study in 11 patients with ISM, patients reported significant improvements in symptoms and improved quality of life measures. suggest that AK002 could provide significant benefit to patients suffering from these diseases and highlight AK002's potential to broadly inhibit mast cells in different disease settings.  In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial in 51 healthy volunteers, all doses of AK002 resulted in complete depletion of blood eosinophils within one hour after administration. The duration of depletion was dose-dependent, with a single dose of 1.0 mg/kg of AK002 suppressing eosinophils for up to 84 days. Depletion of blood eosinophils was also observed in the AK002 ISM and CU clinical studies.  We are currently testing AK002 in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial in patients with EG and/or EGE. EG and EGE are severe eosinophilic inflammatory diseases of the stomach and small intestine, respectively."	Yes

The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential.

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 364 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks.  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2017 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates. Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables.	No

A bill to prevent discrimination and harassment in employment.	"Bringing an End to Harassment by Enhancing Accountability and Rejecting Discrimination in the Workplace Act or the BE HEARD in the Workplace Act

This bill sets forth provisions to prevent discrimination and harassment in the workplace and raises the minimum wage for tipped employees.

Specifically, the bill (1) makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an individual in the workplace based on sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth, and a sex stereotype; (2) prohibits employers from entering into contracts or agreements with workers that contain certain nondisparagement or nondisclosure clauses; (3) prohibits predispute arbitration agreements and postdispute agreements with certain exceptions, and (4) establishes grant programs to prevent and respond to workplace discrimination and harassment, provide legal assistance for low-income workers related to employment discrimination, and establish a system of legal advocacy in states to protect the rights of workers.

Additionally, the bill, among other things

 requires employers who have 15 or more employees to adopt a comprehensive nondiscrimination policy; requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to provide specified training and resource materials, establish and convene a harassment prevention task force, and establish an Office of Education and Outreach with regard to prohibited discrimination and harassment in employment; requires specified studies, reports, and research on prohibited harassment in employment; and grants employees the right to retain their tips."	Allogene Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology company pioneering the development and commercialization of genetically engineered allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of cancer. We are developing a pipeline of off-the-shelf T cell product candidates that are designed to target and kill cancer cells. Our engineered T cells are allogeneic, meaning they are derived from healthy donors for intended use in any patient, rather than from an individual patient for that patient's use, as in the case of autologous T cells. In collaboration with Servier, we are developing UCART19 and ALLO-501, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell product candidates targeting CD19. Servier is sponsoring two Phase 1 clinical trials of UCART19 in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), one for adult patients (the CALM trial) and one for pediatric patients (the PALL trial). In January 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared our investigational new drug application (IND) for ALLO-501, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial (the ALPHA trial) in the first half of 2019 for the treatment of R/R non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In addition, we have a deep pipeline of allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates targeting multiple promising antigens in a host of hematological malignancies and solid tumors. For example, we plan to submit an IND and initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2019 for ALLO-715, an allogeneic CAR T cell product candidate targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) for the treatment of R/R multiple myeloma. We believe our management team's experience in immuno-oncology and specifically in CAR T cell therapy will help drive the rapid development and, if approved, the commercialization of these potentially curative therapies for patients with aggressive cancer.  CAR T cell therapy, a form of cancer immunotherapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with hematologic cancers, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two autologous anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies, Kymriah, developed by Novartis International AG (Novartis), and Yescarta, developed by Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite), were approved by the FDA for the treatment of R/R B-cell precursor ALL (Kymriah) and R/R large B-cell lymphoma (Yescarta). Autologous CAR T cell therapies are manufactured individually for the patient's use by modifying the patient's own T cells outside the body, causing the T cells to express CARs. The entire manufacturing process is dependent on the viability of each patient's T cells and takes approximately two to four weeks. As seen in the registrational trials for Kymriah and Yescarta, up to 31% of intended patients ultimately did not receive treatment primarily due to interval complications from the underlying disease during manufacturing or manufacturing failures.  Our allogeneic approach involves engineering healthy donor T cells, which we believe will allow for the creation of an inventory of off-the-shelf products that can be delivered to a larger portion of eligible patients throughout the world. Our allogeneic T cell development strategy has four key pillars: (1) developing product candidates to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), a condition where allogeneic T cells can recognize the patient's normal tissue as foreign and cause damage, (2) creating a window of persistence that may enable allogeneic T cells to expand in patients, (3) building a leading manufacturing platform and (4) leveraging next generation technologies to improve the functionality of allogeneic CAR T cells.  We use Cellectis, S.A. (Cellectis), TALEN gene-editing technology with the goal of limiting the risk of GvHD by engineering T cells to lack functional T cell receptors (TCRs) that are no longer capable of recognizing a patient's normal tissue as foreign. With the goal of enhancing the expansion and persistence of our engineered allogeneic T cells, we use TALEN to inactivate the CD52 gene in donor T cells and an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody to deplete CD52 expressing T cells in patients while sparing the therapeutic allogeneic T cells. We believe this enables a window of persistence for the infused allogeneic T cells to actively target and destroy cancer cells. Our off-the-shelf approach is dependent on state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, and we are building a technical operations organization with fully integrated in-house expertise in clinical and commercial engineered T cell manufacturing. In February 2019, we entered into a lease to build our own cell therapy manufacturing facility in Newark, California. Finally, we plan to leverage next generation technologies to improve the functionality of our product candidates and to develop more potent product candidates. We believe next generation technologies will also allow us to develop allogeneic T cell therapies for the treatment of solid tumors, which to date have been difficult to treat because of the lack of validated targets and tumor microenvironments that can impair the activity of T cells.  We are currently developing a pipeline of multiple allogeneic CAR T cell product candidates utilizing protein engineering, gene editing, gene insertion and advanced proprietary T cell manufacturing technologies.

Alta Mesa Resources Inc	We were originally formed in November 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of 15,133,333 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to Silver Run Sponsor II, LLC (the Sponsor) generating gross proceeds to us of $22,700,000. A total of $1.035 billion (including approximately $36.2 million in deferred underwriting commissions to the underwriters of the IPO), which represents $1.0143 billion of the proceeds from the IPO after deducting upfront underwriting commissions of $20.7 million, and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account (the Trust Account) to be used to fund an initial business combination. · SRII Opco distributed to the Kingfisher Contributor cash in the amount of approximately $814.8 million in partial payment for the ownership interests in Kingfisher contributed by the Kingfisher Contributor; and · SRII Opco entered into a voting agreement with the owners of the remaining 10% voting interests in Alta Mesa GP whereby such other owners agreed to vote their interests in Alta Mesa GP as directed by SRII Opco.  Following the completion of the Business Combination, the size of our board of directors was expanded from four directors to 11, including one director appointed by Bayou City and its affiliates, one director appointed by HPS and its affiliates and two directors appointed by AM Management and its affiliates, as the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and three directors appointed by the Riverstone Contributor and its affiliates, as the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock. Founded in 1987, Alta Mesa, the predecessor to our E & P Business, was an independent exploration and production company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.  Our Midstream Business was started by Kingfisher on January 30, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating midstream oil and gas assets. We primarily focus on providing crude oil gathering, gas gathering and processing and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate in the STACK play. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 308 miles of existing low and high pressure pipelines, a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, 10 MMcf/d in offtake processing, compression facilities, crude storage, NGL storage and purchasing and marketing capabilities.  Our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling and gas gathering in the STACK.

To amend title XIX to extend protection for Medicaid recipients of home and community-based services against spousal impoverishment, establish a State Medicaid option to provide coordinated care to children with complex medical conditions through health homes, prevent the misclassification of drugs for purposes of the Medicaid drug rebate program, and for other purposes.	"Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019

This bill alters several Medicaid programs and funding provisions.

(Sec. 2) The bill temporarily extends the applicability of Medicaid eligibility criteria that protect against spousal impoverishment for recipients of home- and community-based services.

(Sec. 3) The bill also establishes a state Medicaid option to provide for medical assistance with respect to coordinated care provided through a health home (i.e., a designated provider or team of health-care professionals) for children with medically complex conditions. States must determine payment methodologies in accordance with specified requirements; payments also temporarily qualify for an enhanced federal matching rate.

(Sec. 4) The bill also temporarily extends the Medicaid demonstration program for certified community behavioral health clinics.

(Sec. 5) The bill increases funding available to the Money Follows the Person Rebalancing Demonstration Program. (Under this program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may award grants to state Medicaid programs to assist states in increasing the use of home and community care for long-term care and decreasing the use of institutional care.)

(Sec. 6) Further, drug manufacturers with Medicaid rebate agreements for covered outpatient drugs must disclose drug product information. Manufacturers are subject to civil penalties for knowingly misclassifying drugs. Manufacturers are also required to compensate for rebates that were initially underpaid as a result of misclassification (whether or not such misclassification was committed knowingly)."	Akcea Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing and marketing drugs globally to treat patients with rare and serious diseases. We are bringing novel and transformative medicines to patients by driving clinical program execution, understanding patient and physician needs, preparing the market, creating market access, and commercializing our products on a global basis. As an affiliate of Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, we have a robust portfolio of development-, registration- and commercial-stage drugs covering multiple targets and diseases using antisense therapeutics. Our immediate focus is on the commercial launch of our first commercially approved therapy, TEGSEDI in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or E.U., and Canada. TEGSEDI treats the polyneuropathy caused by hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, or hATTR amyloidosis, in adults. We estimate that there are approximately 50,000 patients globally with hATTR amyloidosis, the majority of whom have symptoms of polyneuropathy. We are also focused on commercial preparations for WAYLIVRA in the E.U. and on regulatory discussions for WAYLIVRA in the U.S. and Canada. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has adopted a positive opinion recommending conditional marketing authorization of WAYLIVRA as an adjunct to diet in adult patients with genetically confirmed familial chylomicronemia syndrome, or FCS, who are at high risk for pancreatitis, in whom response to diet and triglyceride lowering therapy has been inadequate. The positive opinion will now be referred to the EC, which grants marketing authorization for medicines in the European Union, as well as to European Economic Area members Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. FCS is an ultra-rare, devastating hereditary disease that causes unpredictable and potentially fatal acute pancreatitis, chronic complications due to permanent organ damage, and a severe impact on daily living. We are advancing a mature pipeline of novel drugs with the potential to treat multiple diseases. APO(a)-L Rx , AKCEA-ANGPTL3-L Rx , AKCEA-APOCIII-L Rx and AKCEA-TTR-L Rx , are all based on Ionis' antisense technology platform. Ionis' advanced Ligand Conjugated Antisense, or LICA, technology, which enhances the effective uptake and activity of these drugs in particular tissues.  TEGSEDI is the world's first subcutaneous, RNA-targeted therapeutic that substantially reduces the production of transthyretin, or TTR protein. Importantly, TEGSEDI is Akcea's first commercially approved drug, and our launch is underway in three regions: the U.S., the E.U. and Canada. We are continuing to build our commercial infrastructure to support TEGSEDI, and plan to use this infrastructure to support WAYLIVRA and the other drugs in our pipeline, if approved in the future as we anticipate further commercialization in serious and rare diseases. A key element of our commercial strategy is to provide the specialized, patient-centric support required to successfully address rare disease patient populations. We believe our focus on treating patients with inadequately addressed rare and serious diseases will allow us to partner efficiently and effectively with the specialized medical community that supports these underserved patient communities. For example, at approval we launched Akcea Connect TM , a drug treatment program made up of dedicated, regionally-based nurse case managers who have a wide range of medical knowledge and experience, in the United States. This program offers free, private and personalized support to patients and their caregivers and families across the country. Internationally, Akcea Connect is being rolled out in each of the countries where we launch with what we believe is the highest level of patient and physician support allowed in accordance with local regulations. Accredo to be our specialty pharmacy partner for the distribution of TEGSEDI in the U.S. We chose Express Scripts' Accredo Health Group, Inc., or Accredo because of their experience supporting the unique needs of rare disease communities and their proven track record for simplifying access to therapy. Accredo has a team of specialty clinicians, pharmacists and over 600 field-based nurses located throughout the U.S. who are augmenting the Akcea Connect team of nurse case managers to provide support and address the needs of the hATTR amyloidosis community. To further support the hATTR amyloidosis community, Akcea and Ambry Genetics Corporation, or Ambry, a Konica Minolta company, launched hATTR Compass™ in the U.S. and Canada, a no-cost, confidential genetic testing and genetic counseling program for people with suspected hATTR amyloidosis.

Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject 3 to annual adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company, and, in some cases, the Company owns or leases some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA, and leases or subleases, as applicable, such aircraft to the regional carrier.  In return, the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such CPA exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2019 , Star Alliance carriers served over 1,300 airports in 193 countries with 18,800 daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways In addition to its members, Star Alliance includes Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines as a connecting partner.  United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carrier's selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras S.A. In addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air partners, United also offers a train-to-plane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark on select city pairs in the northeastern United States.  United also participates in four passenger joint business arrangements (""JBAs""): one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes, one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand and one with Avianca and Copa Airlines, which, upon receipt of regulatory approvals will cover routes between the United States and Central and South America, excluding Brazil. These passenger JBAs enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering enhanced customer benefits, such as highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. United also participates in cargo JBAs with ANA for transpacific cargo services and with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services.

To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, a cure.	Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.	Align Technology, Inc.	"""Align"") is a global medical device company engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign® clear aligners and iTero® intraoral scanners and services for orthodontics, and restorative and aesthetic dentistry. Align's products are intended primarily for the treatment of malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth and are designed to help dental professionals achieve the clinical outcomes that they expect. We sell the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists (""GPs""), as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons. In addition, we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations (DSOs) who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including non-clinical operations, and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products to assist in the provision of oral health care by a licensed dentist. We received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course. Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals and/or labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013. Scanners and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (""CAD/CAM"") services are primarily sold through our direct sales force and a few distributors in North America, Europe and certain Asia Pacific countries, and through distribution partners in smaller non-core international country markets.  Clear Aligner Segment Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the population. Annually, approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth but are unlikely to seek treatment through a doctor's office. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connect them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.  The Invisalign System The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic, removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases: Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares and sends us a patient's treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a digital scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane (or ""PVS"") impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional's election, x-rays of the patient's dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Align's iTero scanner or a few qualified third-party scanners. See ""Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission. "" More than 63% of Invisalign case submissions are submitted via digital scan instead of a physical PVS impression.  Using propriety software which we do not sell, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan.

A bill to reauthorize the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System Act of 2009, to clarify the authority of the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with respect to post-storm assessments, and to require the establishment of a National Water Center, and for other purposes.	"Coordinated Ocean Observations and Research Act of 2019

This bill reauthorizes through FY2024 and revises the Integrated Coastal and Ocean Observation System (IOOS), which is a network of federal and regional entities that provide information about the nation's coasts, oceans, and Great Lakes, as well as new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect the environment.

The bill revises the authority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to conduct scientific assessments related to storms, including to (1) direct NOAA to seek public input before the Named Storm Event Model (the official meteorological and oceanographic computerized model which utilizes data to replicate the magnitude, timing, and spatial variations of winds, rainfall, and storm surges associated with named storms for which post-storm assessments are conducted) takes effect, and (2) allow NOAA to deploy sensors to areas in coastal states that are at the highest risk of experiencing geophysical events that would cause indeterminate losses.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	Yes

Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and related products in the United States. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2017, we operated 351 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this market area.  The irrigation industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize long‑term growth rates similar to the pool industry. As irrigation system installations and landscaping often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction, we believe the continued trend in increased housing starts also offers significant growth opportunities for the irrigation industry.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic, along with relatively consistent annual inflationary price increases of 1% to 2% on average passed on by manufacturers and distributors, has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2016 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool, outdoor living and irrigation products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation distribution business is split between residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market. Irrigation activities account for approximately 50% of total spending in the irrigation industry, with the remaining 50% of spending related to power equipment, landscape and specialty outdoor products and accessories. Over the last five years, our irrigation business has benefited from the continued slow recovery of single-family home construction as irrigation system installations and landscape projects typically correlate with, but lag, new home construction.

Founded in 1987, Alta Mesa, the predecessor to our E & P Business, was an independent exploration and production company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.

In the United States, which generally prohibits spirits and wine manufacturers from selling their products directly to consumers, we sell our brands either to distributors or (in states that directly control alcohol sales) to state governments that then sell to retail customers and consumers.  , we use a variety of RTC models, which can be grouped into three categories: owned distribution, partner, and government-controlled markets. We own and operate distribution companies in 14 markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Czechia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Mexico, Poland, Spain, Thailand, and Turkey. In these markets, and in a large portion of the Travel Retail channel, we sell our products directly to retailers, to wholesalers, or, in Canada, to provincial governments. Over the past decade, we began distribution operations in multiple markets outside the United States, as shown in the table below.  In the United Kingdom, we partner in a cost-sharing arrangement with another supplier, Bacardi Limited, to sell a portfolio of both companies In many other markets, including Russia, Japan, Italy, and South Africa, we rely on others to distribute our brands, generally under fixed-term distribution contracts.

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 364 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks.  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2017 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates. Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables.	No

Specifically, the bill (1) makes it an unlawful employment practice to discriminate against an individual in the workplace based on sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition related to pregnancy or childbirth, and a sex stereotype; (2) prohibits employers from entering into contracts or agreements with workers that contain certain nondisparagement or nondisclosure clauses; (3) prohibits predispute arbitration agreements and postdispute agreements with certain exceptions, and (4) establishes grant programs to prevent and respond to workplace discrimination and harassment, provide legal assistance for low-income workers related to employment discrimination, and establish a system of legal advocacy in states to protect the rights of workers.

Additionally, the bill, among other things

 requires employers who have 15 or more employees to adopt a comprehensive nondiscrimination policy; requires the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to provide specified training and resource materials, establish and convene a harassment prevention task force, and establish an Office of Education and Outreach with regard to prohibited discrimination and harassment in employment; requires specified studies, reports, and research on prohibited harassment in employment; and grants employees the right to retain their tips."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to successfully commercialize our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") approved product, Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (""Rhopressa ® Rocklatan TM has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") goal date of March 14, 2019. TM (named Rhokiinsa® and Roclanda TM, respectively, in Europe) for regulatory approval in Europe and Japan and expect to commercialize on our own in Europe and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan, if approved. We are also focused on furthering the development of our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases and expect to have two preclinical implants, AR-1105 and AR-13503, commence clinical trials in 2019. Further, we are screening our owned library of Rho kinase (""ROCK"") inhibitors for indications beyond glaucoma.  Rhopressa® is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned ROCK inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Early indications point to healthcare professionals prescribing Rhopressa® as a concomitant therapy to prostaglandins or non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) medications when additional IOP reduction is desired. We believe Rhopressa® is primarily competing with other non-PGA products, due to its targeting of the diseased trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, its preferred once-daily dosing relative to other currently marketed non-PGA products and its safety profile. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  We launched Rhopressa® in the United States at the end of April 2018. Rhopressa® is now being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rhopressa® through pharmacies across the United States. In the glaucoma market in the United States, approximately half of the dispensed volumes are covered under commercial plans and half under Medicare Part D. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® for approximately 90% of lives covered under commercial plans and approximately 40% of lives covered under Medicare Part D plans. We expect Medicare Part D Tier 2 equivalent coverage to increase to over 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Rocklatan TM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Rocklatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Rocklatan TM, if approved and formulary coverage is obtained, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.  We submitted a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Rocklatan TM to the FDA in May 2018 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the ""FDCA""), which provides for an abbreviated approval pathway, since Rocklatan TM is a fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs in the United States. In July 2018, we announced that the NDA was accepted for review by the FDA and the PDUFA goal date was set for March 14, 2019.  Our strategy also includes developing our business outside the United States, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan."	No
To provide for the overall health and well-being of young people, including the promotion of lifelong sexual health and healthy relationships, and for other purposes.	"Real Education for Healthy Youth Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in coordination with certain HHS components, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Education, to award grants for comprehensive sex education for adolescents. It also awards grants for comprehensive sex education provided by institutions of higher education and for training faculty and staff to teach comprehensive sex education to adolescents. Comprehensive sex education programs may include, among other things, instruction that addresses the physical, mental, emotional, and social dimensions of human sexuality and approaches designed to motivate and assist students to maintain and improve their sexual health, prevent disease and reduce sexual health-related risk behaviors.

Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	No

Prologis, Inc.	"Business Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Internal Revenue Code""). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. We operate and evaluate our business on an owned and managed (""O & M"") basis, including properties that we wholly-own and properties that are owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We make decisions based on the property operations, regardless of our ownership interest. Our investment consists of our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata (or ownership) share of the properties owned in ventures.  THE COMPANY Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing and property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategies, we have integrated the properties while adding minimal property management expenses . Our results for 2018 include the DCT port folio from the date of acquisition . At December 31, 2018, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through ventures, in the following regions (dollars in billions, based on gross book value and total expected investment (as defined below) and square feet in millions):  Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of one year after completion or reaching 90% occupancy. Amounts represent our total expected investment (""TEI""), which includes the estimated cost of development or expansion, including land, construction and leasing costs.  Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (""FFO"").

Public Storage	"We acquire, develop, own and operate self-storage facilities , which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use.

We are seeking to expand our third-party management operations to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand; however, there is no 5 assurance that we will be able to do so.

We believe that our customers genera lly store their goods within a three to f ive mile radius of their home or business . Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.  We believe that we have significant market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers, with approximately 71 % of our 201 8 same-store revenues generated in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (each, an ""MSA"", as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) with the highest population levels. Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

We are a leading innovator of sensory experiences that move the world. We co-create unique products that consumers taste, smell, or touch. Our expanded geographical footprint and product portfolio position us to better serve both our global customers and the growing regional, mid-sized and smaller specialty customers.  Through the acquisition, of Frutarom we increased our product portfolio with complementary adjacencies, such as natural colors, antioxidants for food preservation, nutraceuticals, ingredients for infant formula and proteins for elderly nutrition, and expanded core product lines with savory solutions aimed at the meat and fish industry, citrus and other naturals flavors, specialty ingredients and new cosmetic actives. As a result, we now have over 90,000 products within our portfolio that are provided to customers in approximately 195 countries, which includes a significant number of faster-growing small and mid-sized customers.  Prior to our acquisition of Frutarom, we had 37 manufacturing facilities and 21 creative centers and application laboratories, located in 35 different countries. Upon our acquisition of Frutarom, we acquired 60 additional manufacturing facilities and 84 additional R & D/application laboratories globally, including many of the countries in which we currently operate. The 2018 combined sales of IFF and Frutarom, which combines the full year 2018 sales of both Frutarom and IFF, was approximately $5.1 billion which, management believes, makes us the second largest company in the taste, scent and nutrition industry. Based on our 2018 combined sales, approximately 35% of our customers are global consumer products companies while approximately 65% of our customers are small and mid-sized companies.  During 2018, our 25 largest customers accounted for 47% of our sales, however as a result of the effect of the Frutarom acquisition, our 25 largest customers only accounted for 37% of our 2018 combined sales. As our customers seek to grow their businesses in emerging markets, we provide them the ability to leverage our long-standing international presence and extensive market knowledge to help drive their brands in these markets.  During 2018, we continued to grow in our Re-Imagine modulation and PowderPure clean label portfolios, developed two new molecules which will be launched in 2019 and continued research into olfactory receptors and maximizing the nutritional value of our naturals. Our goal is to attain commercial excellence by providing our customers with in-depth, local consumer understanding, industry-leading innovation, outstanding service and the highest quality products. During 2018, we continued to reflect our customers' focus on naturals and environmental sustainability as IFF-LMR Naturals increased the number of our organic certified sites and have received the Expertise Vegan Europe (EVE) Vegan certification for a portfolio of 90 of our natural extracts. Consumers, and therefore our customers, are continuing to focus on sensorial products that are responsibly sourced. Consequently, an integral component of this pillar is our ongoing commitment to sustainability We prioritize opportunities that provide (i) access to new technologies, (ii) the ability to increase our market share in key markets and with key customers or (iii) access to adjacent products or services that will position us to leverage our expertise in science and technology and our customer base. In addition to significantly expanding our customer base into the faster-growing midsize and smaller companies, the Frutarom acquisition allowed us to expand our cosmetic active ingredients business and enter into the attractive adjacent markets of savory solutions, natural colors, natural food protection and health and wellness products, including nutraceuticals and enzymes.  Our fragrance business derives revenue from two sources, Fragrance Compounds and Ingredients. We are a global leader in the creation of fragrance compounds that are integral elements in the world's finest perfumes and best-known consumer products, within fabric care, home care, personal wash, hair care and toiletries. Our Fragrance Ingredients business is a vertically integrated operation, originating with the development in our research laboratories of naturals, synthetic and proprietary molecules and innovative delivery systems, progressing to our manufacturing facilities that produce these ingredients in a consistent, high-quality and cost-effective manner and transitioning to our creative centers and application laboratories where our perfumers partner with our customers to create unique fragrance compounds for use in a variety of end-use products.

To amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 and the Head Start Act to promote child care and early learning, and for other purposes.	"Child Care for Working Families Act

This bill provides funds and otherwise revises certain child care and early learning programs for low- to moderate-income families.

Specifically, the bill provides funds for the Child Care and Development Block Grant program and reestablishes it as a child care and development assistance program. It also allocates program funds for states to provide services and support to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities.

Further, it revises the program to require each state to, among other things

 create a tiered and transparent system for measuring the quality of child care providers, which must include evidence-based standards and payment rates that are based on a certain cost estimation model; assure that copayments are based on a sliding scale and that no family receiving assistance pays more than 7% of their household income on child care; and use quality child care amounts for certain activities, such as improving the supply of child care providers who provide care to infants, toddlers, and children with disabilities (e.g., professional development). It also provides funds and establishes grants for states to create preschool programs for low- to moderate-income children between the ages of three and five years.

Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services must make grants to Head Start agencies to (1) provide children with access to full-school-year and full-school-day services, (2) provide access to additional service hours for migrant and seasonal agencies, or (3) enhance the quality of existing services."

"any amounts in addition to what has been already accrued by AMD for future remediation costs under clean-up orders will not be material; we expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate; anticipated increase in costs related to enhancing, implementing and monitoring information security controls, remediating any data security breaches and addressing related litigation, mitigating reputational harm and compliance with external regulations related to our IT assets; we expect to receive $448.5 million upon the exercise of a warrant by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and issue 75 million shares of our common stock to WCH; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied which will be recognized over the next 12 months; and a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD's revenue in the future. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

Aduro BioTech, Inc.	We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	Yes

(icosapent ethyl) capsules, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe This FDA-approved indication for Vascepa, known as the MARINE indication, is based primarily on the successful results from the MARINE study of Vascepa in this approved patient population. In considering this approval, FDA also reviewed the successful results from our study of Vascepa in patients with high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL and <500 mg/dL) who are also on statin therapy for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, levels This study is known as the ANCHOR study. Safety data from both the MARINE and ANCHOR studies are reflected in FDA-approved labeling for Vascepa. In January 2013, we began selling and marketing Vascepa in the United States based on the FDA-approved MARINE indication. In August 2015, we began communicating promotional information beyond the MARINE indication to healthcare professionals in the United States based on the federal court declaration described below. In March 2016, we reached agreement with the FDA and U.S. government under which they agreed to be bound by the terms of the August 2015 judicial declaration.

Triglycerides are the main constituent of body fat in humans. Hypertriglyceridemia refers to a condition in which patients have high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream. It is estimated that approximately 70 million adults in the United States have elevated triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 150 mg/dL), approximately 40 million adults in the United States have high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 200 mg/dL), and approximately 3 to 4 million adults in the United States have severely high triglyceride levels (TG ≥ 500 mg/dL), commonly known as very high triglyceride levels. Many patients with high triglyceride levels also have diabetes and other lipid level abnormalities such as high cholesterol. The patient condition of having more than one lipid level abnormality is referred to as mixed dyslipidemia.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to establish a system to notify individuals approaching Medicare eligibility, to simplify and modernize the eligibility enrollment process, and for other purposes.	"Beneficiary Enrollment Notification and Eligibility Simplification Act of 2019 or the BENES Act of 2019

Specifically, the bill changes the Medicare general enrollment period to October 15-December 31, and requires coverage to begin on the first day of the month following enrollment. (Currently, the general enrollment period is January 1-March 31, and coverage begins July 1.) The bill also generally requires coverage to begin on the first day of the month following enrollment for individuals who enroll in the latter months of their initial enrollment period. (Currently, the longer an individual waits to enroll, the more delayed the effective date of coverage.)

The bill also requires Social Security account statements for individuals ages 60 to 64 to include information about Medicare eligibility, late enrollment penalties, coordination of benefits, and special enrollment populations (e.g., veterans)."	Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	No

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

Acacia Communications, Inc.	Our mission is to deliver high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that transform communications networks, relied upon by cloud infrastructure operators and content and communication service providers, through improvements in performance and capacity and reductions in associated costs. By implementing optical interconnect technology in a silicon-based platform, a process we refer to as the siliconization of optical interconnect, we believe we are leading a disruption that is analogous to the computing industry's integration of multiple functions into a microprocessor. Our products fall into three product groups: embedded modules, pluggable modules and semiconductors. Our embedded module and pluggable module product groups consist of optical interconnect modules with transmission speeds ranging from 100 to 1,200 gigabits per second, or Gbps, for use in long-haul, metro and inter-data center markets. Our semiconductor product group consists of our low-power coherent digital signal processor application-specific integrated circuits, or DSP ASICs, and our silicon photonic integrated circuits, or silicon PICs, which are either integrated into our embedded and pluggable modules or sold to customers on a standalone basis for integration into internally developed or other merchant modules. We are also developing a 400ZR module that will expand our pluggable module product group, and enable inter-data center transmission capacity of 400 Gbps in the same compact pluggable form factors used for 400G client optics, including QSFP-DD and OSFP. Our modules perform a majority of the digital signal processing and optical functions in optical interconnects and offer low power consumption, high density and high speeds at attractive price points. Through the use of standard interfaces, our modules can be easily integrated with customers' network equipment. The advanced software in our modules enables increased configurability and automation, provides insight into network and connection point characteristics and helps identify network performance problems, all of which increase flexibility and reduce operating costs.  Our modules are rooted in our low-power coherent DSP ASICs and/or silicon PICs, which we have specifically developed for our target markets. Our coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs are manufactured using complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS. CMOS is a widely-used and cost-effective semiconductor process technology. Using CMOS to siliconize optical interconnect technology enables us to integrate increasing functionality into our products, benefit from higher yields and reliability associated with CMOS, capitalize on regular improvements in CMOS performance and density, and reduce costs. Our use of CMOS also enables us to use outsourced foundry services rather than requiring custom fabrication to manufacture our products. In addition, our use of CMOS and CMOS-compatible processes enables us to take advantage of the technology, manufacturing and integration improvements driven by other computer and communications markets that rely on CMOS.  Our engineering and management teams have extensive experience in optical systems and networking, digital signal processing, large-scale ASIC design and verification, silicon photonic design and integration, system software development, hardware design and high-speed electronics design. This broad expertise in a range of advanced technologies, methodologies and processes enhances our innovation, design and development capabilities, and has enabled us, and we believe will continue to enable us, to develop and introduce state-of-the-art optical interconnect modules, coherent DSP ASICs and silicon PICs. In the course of our product development cycles, we engage with our customers as they design their current and next-generation network equipment in order to gauge current and future market needs.  We sell our products through a direct sales force to leading network equipment manufacturers, network operators and cloud service providers. Industry Background Growing Demand for Bandwidth and Network Capacity Global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic is projected to more than triple from 4.1 exabytes per day in 2017 to 13.2 exabytes per day in 2022, representing a projected 26% compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index: Forecast and Trends, 2017-2022, dated November 2018, or the VNI Report. This projected rapid growth in IP traffic is the result of several factors, including: •  Over the last decade, the proliferation of new technologies, applications, Web 2.0-based services and Internet-connected devices has led to increasing levels of Internet traffic and congestion and the need for greater bandwidth. Video traffic, in particular, is growing rapidly, and placing significant strains on network capacity.

Acquire, develop, lease, own and manage a diversified portfolio of quality healthcare properties across multiple geographic locations and business segments, including senior housing, life science, and medical office, among others; •  Align ourselves with leading healthcare companies, operators and service providers which, over the long-term, should result in higher relative rental rates, net operating cash flows and appreciation of property values; and  Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is to: (i) work with new or existing tenants and operators to address their space and capital needs; and (ii) provide high-quality property management services in order to motivate tenants to renew, expand or relocate into our properties.  Build and maintain long-term leasing and management relationships with quality tenants and operators. In choosing locations for our properties, we focus on their physical environment, adjacency to established businesses (e.g., hospital systems) and educational centers, proximity to sources of business growth and other local demographic factors.  Replace tenants and operators at the best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and operators and achieve attractive rental rates and operating cash flow as a result of the location, design and maintenance of our properties, together with our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer space alternatives within our portfolio.  We structure lease extensions, early renewals or modifications, which reduce the cost associated with lease downtime or the re-investment risk resulting from the exercise of tenants' purchase options, while securing the tenancy and relationship of our high quality tenants and operators on a long-term basis.  The delivery of healthcare services requires real estate and, as a result, tenants and operators depend on real estate, in part, to maintain and grow their businesses. We believe that the healthcare real estate market provides investment opportunities due to the: (i) compelling long-term demographics driving the demand for healthcare services; (ii) specialized nature of healthcare real estate investing; and (iii) ongoing consolidation of the fragmented healthcare real estate sector.  While we emphasize healthcare real estate ownership, we may also provide real estate secured financing to, or invest in equity or debt securities of, healthcare operators or other entities engaged in healthcare real estate ownership. We monitor, but do not limit, our investments based on the percentage of our total assets that may be invested in any one property type, investment vehicle or geographic location, the number of properties that may be leased to a single tenant or operator, or loans that may be made to a single borrower. In allocating capital, we target opportunities with the most attractive risk/reward profile for our portfolio as a whole. We may take additional measures to mitigate risk, including diversifying our investments (by sector, geography, tenant or operator), structuring transactions as master leases, requiring tenant or operator insurance and indemnifications, and obtaining credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits.  our relationships with leading healthcare operators and systems, investment banks and other market intermediaries, corporations, private equity firms, non-profits and public institutions seeking to monetize existing assets or develop new facilities;  our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality healthcare real estate; • our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions responsively and efficiently, which provides confidence to domestic and foreign institutions and private investors who seek to sell healthcare real estate in our market areas; •  our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the healthcare and real estate industries; and • our control of sites (including assets under contract with radius restrictions).

A bill to establish a Medicare-for-all national health insurance program.	"Medicare for All Act of 2019

This bill establishes a national health insurance program that is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

Among other requirements, the program must (1) cover all U.S. residents; (2) provide for automatic enrollment of individuals upon birth or residency in the United States; and (3) cover items and services that are medically necessary or appropriate to maintain health or to diagnose, treat, or rehabilitate a health condition, including hospital services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, dental and vision services, and home- and community-based long-term care.

The bill prohibits cost-sharing (e.g., deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments) and other charges for covered services, with the exception of prescription drugs. Additionally, private health insurers and employers may only offer coverage that is supplemental to, and not duplicative of, benefits provided under the program.

Health insurance exchanges and specified federal health programs terminate upon program implementation. However, the program does not affect coverage provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Indian Health Service. Additionally, state Medicaid programs must cover certain institutional long-term care services.

The bill also establishes a series of implementing provisions relating to (1) health care provider participation; (2) HHS administration; and (3) payments and costs, including the requirement that HHS negotiate prices for prescription drugs and establish a formulary.

Individuals who are age 18 or younger may enroll in the program starting one year after enactment of this bill; other individuals may buy into a transitional plan or an expanded Medicare program at this time, depending on age. The bill's program must be fully implemented four years after enactment."	Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	Yes

A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

Abeona Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.

We produce a wide range of products, ranging from coated freesheet and coated groundwood, to specialty papers, packaging papers, inkjet and digital papers, supercalendered papers and uncoated freesheet.  We also produce and sell bleached and unbleached market kraft pulp, which is used to manufacture paper and packaging products.  The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,970,000 tons of paper.  We sell and market our products to approximately 300 customers which comprise approximately 1,300 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading magazine and catalog publishers, commercial printers, specialty retail merchandisers and paper merchants. We reach our end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers.  whereby we agreed to sell to Pixelle, or the ""Pixelle Sale,"" all of the outstanding membership interests in Verso Androscoggin, LLC an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso and the entity that, as of the closing date, held all the assets primarily related to Verso's Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine, and Stevens Point Mill, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The consideration for the sale will be subject to final post-closing adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Pixelle Sale reduced the aggregate annual production capacity of our mills by approximately 660,000 tons. On April 30, 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of our paper mill in Luke, Maryland in response to the continuing decline in customer demand for the grades of coated freesheet paper produced at the Luke Mill, along with rising input costs, a significant influx of imports and rising compliance costs and infrastructure challenges associated with environmental regulation. The shutdown of the Luke Mill reduced our coated freesheet production capacity by approximately 450,000 tons and eliminated approximately 675 positions at the Luke Mill.  Based on total industry 2019 sales and other market research, we estimate the size of the global coated paper industry to be approximately 35 million tons, including approximately 5 million tons in North America. Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in gross domestic product. The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand driven primarily by the growth in digital media (see ""Item 1A. - The paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability has been adversely impacted by such decline"").  In North America, coated papers are classified by brightness and fall into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly grades containing groundwood. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.  Within the paper industry, specialty papers are products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacturing, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes or custom engineered applications. Specialty papers have unique functional properties and are usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement."	No

To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, a cure.	Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.	Abeona Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2018, Star Alliance carriers served 1,300 airports in 191 countries with 18,400 daily departures.

Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	No

Allegiant Travel Co.	Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding future expense, capacity growth, expected capital expenditures, number of contracted aircraft to be placed in service in the future, future expansion of our golf management and family entertainment center businesses, the development and financing of our Sunseeker Resort, as well as other information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel services and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed primarily to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flight arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us.  Most recently, and in conjunction with our leisure travel focus, we are developing Sunseeker Resort in Florida, operating a golf course near the resort location, managing a golf course management solution and beginning to open family entertainment centers in cities in our route network.  Below is a brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers: Scheduled service air transportation.  We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency, nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of that date, we were selling travel on 450 routes to 122 cities. We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority 4 boarding, a customer convenience fee, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. The revenue for ancillary air-related products and services is reflected in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, along with scheduled service air transportation revenue.  We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms and ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) for sale to our passengers. The marketing component of revenue related to our co-branded credit card is also accounted for in this category.  We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis.  We may choose to temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft and/or engines. We are also currently leasing spare engines to a third party and may choose to act as lessor temporarily in the future on an opportunistic basis. This line item also includes revenue from our golf course acquired in 2018 and our management solution to golf courses around the country.  We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the significant costs associated with serving a wide variety of customers and to concentrate our product appeal on a customer base which is under-served by traditional airlines. Unbundled pricing of air-related services and products By unbundling our air-related services and products such as baggage fees, advance seat assignments, travel protection, change fees, priority boarding, and food and beverage purchases , we are able to lower our airfares and target leisure travelers who are more concerned with price and the ability to customize their experience with us by only purchasing the additional conveniences they value. We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 405 routes (and currently selling 450 routes) between 99 origination cities and 23 leisure destinations, and serving 42 states and Puerto Rico as of February 15, 2019.

Acceleron Pharma, Inc.	"We are a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta superfamily therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we have generated several innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. We have focused and prioritized our research and development activities within three key therapeutic areas: hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.  Luspatercept, our lead program, and sotatercept, are partnered with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. Luspatercept is an investigational erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell production through a novel mechanism, and is being developed to treat chronic anemia and associated complications in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis. In 2018, we and Celgene announced positive results for two Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept; one for the treatment of patients with lower-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, known as the MEDALIST trial, and another for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, also known as the BELIEVE trial. In the MEDALIST trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence of at least 8 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. In the BELIEVE trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33 percent reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks, from week 13 to week 24, compared to placebo. Results from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials were then presented during plenary and oral sessions, respectively, at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2018, and we expect to submit these results for publication during 2019. ""Best of ASH,"" chosen from among the thousands of meeting abstracts as  ""the biggest breakthroughs from the meeting's scientific presentations. We and Celgene are planning regulatory application submissions for luspatercept in both MDS and beta-thalassemia in the United States in April 2019 and in Europe in the first half of 2019.  In addition to the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept, Celgene is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the BEYOND trial, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in 2020. Celgene has also initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial, the COMMANDS trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients and enrollment is ongoing. Enrollment is also currently ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted by Celgene for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in the second half of 2019. If luspatercept were to receive regulatory approval for each of these indications in the United States and Europe, we believe that there is an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $2 billion across the indications in the BEYOND trial and the luspatercept Phase 3 clinical trials, and an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $1 billion in myelofibrosis. We and Celgene are also evaluating further research of luspatercept for the treatment of anemia in potential new indications that could provide additional sales opportunities.  For sotatercept, we have the rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, which we refer to as the PH field, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. We are currently enrolling the PULSAR Phase 2 clinical trial of sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH with preliminary results expected in the first half of 2020, and we recently initiated an exploratory study, called SPECTRA, in the first quarter of 2019 to provide us with further understanding of sotatercept's impact on PAH. If sotatercept is commercialized to treat PAH and we recognize such revenue, then Celgene will be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales. For luspatercept and, outside of the PH field, sotatercept, Celgene is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials. ACE-083 is designed for the treatment of focal muscle disorders, and we are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, as well as in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT."

We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	No

The Company focuses on the development of open and flexible solutions that enable users to analyze designs directly on the desktop, providing a common platform for fast, efficient and cost-conscious product development, from design concept to final-stage testing and validation. The Company distributes its ANSYS® suite of simulation technologies through a global network of independent resellers and distributors (collectively, channel partners) and direct sales offices in strategic, global locations. The Company operates and reports as one segment.  ANSYS Workbench™ ANSYS Workbench is the framework upon which the Company's suite of advanced engineering simulation technologies is built. The innovative project schematic view ties together the entire simulation process, guiding the user through complex multiphysics analyses with drag-and-drop simplicity. With bi-directional computer-aided design (CAD) connectivity, powerful highly-automated meshing, a project-level update mechanism, pervasive parameter management and integrated optimization tools, the ANSYS Workbench platform enables Pervasive Engineering Simulation™.  The Company's Workbench framework allows engineers and designers to incorporate the compounding effects of multiple physics into a virtual prototype of their design and simulate its operation under real-world conditions. As product architectures become smaller, lighter and more complex, companies must be able to accurately predict how products will behave in real-world environments where multiple types of physics interact in a coupled way. ANSYS multiphysics software enables engineers to simulate the interactions between structures, heat transfer, fluids and electronics all within a single, unified engineering simulation environment.  ANSYS Workbench enables companies to create a customized simulation environment to deploy specialized simulation best practices and automations unique to their product development process or industry. With ANSYS ACT™, end users or ANSYS partners can modify the user interface, process simulation data or embed third-party applications to create specialized tools based on ANSYS Workbench.  The Company's high-performance computing (HPC) product suite enables enhanced insight into product performance and improves the productivity of the design process. The HPC product suite delivers cross-physics parallel processing capabilities for the full spectrum of the Company's simulation software by supporting structures, fluids, thermal and electronics simulations. This product suite decreases turnaround time for individual simulations, allowing users to consider multiple design ideas and make the right design decisions early in the design cycle.  The Company's structural analysis product suite offers simulation tools for product design and optimization that increase productivity, minimize physical prototyping and help to deliver better and more innovative products in less time. These tools tackle real-world analysis problems by making product development less costly and more reliable. In addition, these tools have capabilities that cover a broad range of analysis types, elements, contacts, materials, equation solvers and coupled physics capabilities, all targeted toward understanding and solving complex design problems. The Company also provides comprehensive topology optimization tools that engineers use to design structural components to meet loading requirements with minimal material and component weight. The Company offers a complete simulation workflow for additive manufacturing that allows reliable 3D printing by simulating the laser sintering process and delivering compensated CAD geometries that ensure reliable printed parts.  The Company's fluids product suite enables modeling of fluid flow and other related physical phenomena. Fluid flow analysis capabilities provide all the tools needed to design and optimize new fluids equipment and to troubleshoot already existing installations. The suite contains general-purpose computational fluid dynamics software and specialized products to address specific industry applications.  The Company's electromagnetics product suite provides field simulation software for designing high-performance electronic and electromechanical products.

The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional operations. With key global aviation rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, UAL has the worlds most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500 flights a day to 338 airports across five continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (Newark), Chicago OHare International Airport (Chicago OHare), The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The 3 hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the worlds largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (Republic), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (CommutAir), ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet), GoJet Airlines (GoJet), Mesa Airlines (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines (SkyWest), Air Wisconsin Airlines (Air Wisconsin), and Trans States Airlines (Trans States) are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (CPAs). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2018, Star Alliance carriers served 1,300 airports in 191 countries with 18,400 daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, Avianca Brasil, Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines.

Founded in 1987, Alta Mesa, the predecessor to our E & P Business, was an independent exploration and production company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.  Our Midstream Business was started by Kingfisher on January 30, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating midstream oil and gas assets. We primarily focus on providing crude oil gathering, gas gathering and processing and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate in the STACK play.

"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	No
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to promote access to life-saving therapies for Medicaid enrollees by ensuring coverage of routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in qualifying clinical trials, and for other purposes.	"Covering Life-saving Investigations Needed in Cancer and Other Life-threatening Conditions through Timely use of Resources for Easy and Affordable Treatment from Medicaid for Enrollees in Need Today Act or the CLINICAL TREATMENT Act

This bill requires state Medicaid programs to cover routine patient costs for items and services that are provided in connection with a qualifying clinical trial regarding cancer or other life-threatening conditions.

The bill defines ""routine patient costs"" to include items and services that would otherwise be covered under Medicaid absent the patient's participation in the clinical trial; the term includes items and services relating to trial complications, but excludes those items and services that are the subject of the trial or that are provided solely in relation to data analysis.

Additionally, a ""qualifying clinical trial"" means, among other things, a clinical trial that is approved or funded by specified entities (e.g., the National Institutes of Health) or is an authorized new drug trial."	Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients'  lives through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic diseases, or RGDs, which are diseases that are directly caused by changes in genes or chromosomes, often passed from one generation to the next. The incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally very infrequent, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000 births. In both areas of cancer and RGDs, we are seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies.  Our first commercial cancer product is IDHIFA®. In August 2017, the FDA granted our collaboration partner Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, approval of IDHIFA® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML, and an IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IDHIFA®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation.  Our most advanced clinical cancer product candidates are ivosidenib, which targets mutated IDH1, and AG-881, which is a brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor. In December 2017, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for ivosidenib for the treatment of patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. We plan to submit an MAA to the EMA for ivosidenib for IDH1 mutant-positive R/R AML in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Our next most advanced cancer product candidate is AG-270, an inhibitor of MAT2A. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AG-270 in November 2017, and in December 2017 the FDA concluded that we may proceed with our planned phase 1 dose-escalation trial of AG-270 in multiple tumor types carrying a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deletion. We expect to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2018.  Our most advanced preclinical cancer product candidate is an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme DHODH. We plan to submit an IND for our DHODH inhibitor for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The lead product candidate in our RGD program, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase, or PK, deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice and lifelong conditions associated with chronic anemia and secondary complications due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells, or RBCs. We intend to initiate two global, pivotal trials of AG-348 in PK deficiency in the first half of 2018: ACTIVATE-T, a single arm trial of approximately 20 regularly transfused patients, is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2018, and ACTIVATE, a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 80 patients who do not receive regular transfusions, is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2018. We also expect to initiate a phase 2 proof of concept trial of AG-348 in thalassemia in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned development programs, we are seeking to advance a number of early-stage discovery programs in the areas of cancer metabolism, RGDs and metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, a developing field which aims to modulate the activity of relevant immune cells by targeting critical metabolic nodes, thereby, enhancing the immune mediated anti-tumor response.  The clinical development strategy for all of our product and development candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our expertise in ""flux biochemistry. This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple networks of metabolic enzymes."

Match Group, Inc.	Match Group, Inc. is a leading provider of subscription dating products servicing North America, Western Europe, Asia and many other regions around the world through websites and applications we own and operate. We operate a portfolio of brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, OurTime, and Pairs as well as a number of other brands, each designed to increase our users' likelihood of finding a meaningful connection. Through our portfolio of trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users. As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the online dating category as a whole.  Given these wide ranging consumer preferences, our strategy focuses on a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We work to apply a centralized discipline to learnings, by sharing best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, human resources, finance, tax, and others. significant growth in our mobile-first dating products, as well as a meaningful shift in the user bases of our previously desktop-oriented dating products, who have gone from accessing those products via desktop devices to accessing our mobile experiences for those products via mobile devices. This shift to mobile, along with the combination of our mobile-first dating products and the deployment of mobile experiences across substantially all of our previously desktop-oriented products, has enabled us to reach groups of users which had previously proven elusive, such as the 18-25 year old audience; for example, Tinder has been able to tap into this audience rapidly over the last few years. Additionally, in previously desktop-oriented products like Match, the shift to mobile has led to increased usage of our products, as mobile users on average access our products at meaningfully higher rates than users who access our products on desktop.  Enabling dating in a digital world Prior to the proliferation of computers and mobile devices, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography and time. Today, the adoption of the internet and mobile technology has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions and develop romantic connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas that previously prevented individuals from using technology to help find and develop those connections.  We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including: •  : Dating products provide users access to a large number of like-minded people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet.  : The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of options in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.  : Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around the process of reaching out to new people. : The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.  Depending on a person's circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes:  Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and a higher level of security. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large, active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users.  : Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. : Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can associate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography or intent (for example, casual dating or more serious relationships), users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify.

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 with the recommended dosing of 34 mg once a day taken as two 17 mg tablets. In June 2018, the FDA approved a 34 mg NUPLAZID capsule formulation that provides patients with the recommended 34 mg once daily dose in a single, small capsule, reducing patient pill burden compared to the previous administration of two 17 mg tablets. In addition, the FDA approved a 10 mg NUPLAZID tablet for patients concomitantly receiving strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, which can inhibit the metabolizing of NUPLAZID .  We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we are continuing to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis is one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we 1 announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 s tudy exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency , we initiated our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementi Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, major depressive disorder, or MDD, affects approximately 16 million adults in the United States, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy. In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in 207 patients with MDD who had a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line, SSRI or SNRI, antidepressant therapy. In the study, pimavanserin met the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and positive results were also observed in seven additional secondary endpoints including response rate, improvement in sexual function, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness. Pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated in the study with no meaningful weight gain or impact on motor function observed. In February 2019, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program for pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in the first half of 2019.  We also believe schizophrenia is a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address certain important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms.

We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet, Groupon is helping local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services.  Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services, generally at a discount. Consumers access those marketplaces through our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries, and our mobile applications.  Our operations are organized into two segments: North America and International. W e offer goods and services through our online marketplaces in three primary categories: We earn product revenue from direct sales of merchandise inventory through our Goods category. We primarily earn service revenue from transactions in which we earn commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Those transactions generally involve a customer's purchase of a voucher through one of our online marketplaces that can be redeemed with a third-party merchant for specified goods or services (or for discounts on specified goods or services). Service revenue also includes commissions that we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications and from voucherless merchant offerings in which customers earn cash back on their credit card statements when they transact with third-party merchants.  The substantial majority of our service revenue transactions is comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. Our goal is to continue to build marketplaces that our customers rely on to discover and save on amazing things to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. With a mobile-first strategy, we intend to improve the customer experience by continuing to invest in innovative, frictionless products and differentiated local supply coupled with strong national brands. As we build out our marketplaces, we want our customers to have a superior, frictionless experience when they use our product whether finding, booking, buying or redeeming an offer. For merchants, this includes providing capabilities to manage demand for their goods and services and improving their ability to acquire customers. For consumers, this includes easily finding offers and accessing features that augment the overall experience, as well as seamlessly purchasing and redeeming offers. We are currently investing in initiatives to improve the purchase and redemption experience, such as enhancing our mobile applications, testing offerings with voucherless redemption resulting in cash back directly to customers' credit cards, and adding direct booking capabilities. We ultimately want Groupon to become a daily habit for our customers and believe that significantly increasing the offerings available through our online local commerce marketplaces is critical to this goal. Our initiatives to grow our inventory of deal offerings include entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, identifying new distribution channels through which to sell our marketplace offerings, and continuing to optimize the activities performed by our sales teams. Additionally, we believe that our efforts to increase our customer value may improve the health of our marketplaces, making our marketing and promotional services more effective for the merchants who feature offerings on our platform.  Our initiatives to grow International gross profit include increasing our international marketing spending and leveraging enhanced marketing analytics, prioritizing more technology resources in order to expand and advance its product and service offerings, growing our inventory of deal offerings by entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, and other initiatives.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the proper tax treatment of personal service income earned in pass-thru entities.	"Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2019

This bill modifies the tax treatment of carried interest, which is compensation that is typically received by a partner of a private equity or hedge fund and is based on a share of the fund's profits. (Under current law, carried interest is taxed as investment income rather than at ordinary income tax rates.)

This bill includes provisions that

 set forth a special rule for the inclusion in gross income of partnership interests transferred in connection with the performance of services, treat as ordinary income the net capital gain with respect to an investment services partnership interest except to the extent such gain is attributable to a partner's qualified capital interest, exempt income from investment services partnership interests from treatment as qualifying income of a publicly traded partnership, exempt certain family partnerships from the application of this bill, increase the penalty for underpayments of tax resulting from failure to treat income from an investment services partnership interest as ordinary income, and include income and loss from an investment services partnership interest for purposes of determining net earnings from self-employment and applicable self-employment taxes. The bill defines ""investment services partnership interest"" as any interest in a partnership held by a person who provides services to a partnership by (1) advising the partnership about investing in, purchasing, or selling specified assets; (2) managing, acquiring, or disposing of specified assets; or (3) arranging financing with respect to acquiring specified assets."	AGNC Investment Corp.	"We fund our investments primarily through borrowings structured as repurchase agreements.  We operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (""REIT"") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code""). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable income. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.  We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (""Agency RMBS"") on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (""Fannie Mae"") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (""Freddie Mac,"" and together with Fannie Mae, the ""GSEs""), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (""Ginnie Mae""). We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency or in other investments in, or related to, the housing, mortgage or real estate markets.  remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""Investment Company Act"").  Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates representing interests in ""pools"" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect  ""passed through"" to the security holders, after deducting GSE or U.S. Government agency guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), which are structured instruments representing interests in Agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific Agency CMO securities.  TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.  CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third-party; rather, ""credit risk transfer"" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. The reduced amount that issuers are obligated to repay to the security holders offsets the issuer's credit losses on the related pool of loans.  Non-Agency RMBS are securities backed by residential mortgages, for which payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of RMBS. Non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Residential non-Agency securities are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or nonprime mortgage loans."	Yes

It invests in private and public equity, fixed income, and multi asset markets across the globe through its subsidiaries. Through its subsidiaries, the firm also invests in alternative markets. It also employs a combination of fundamental and quantitative research to make its investments through its subsidiaries. Legg Mason, Inc. was founded in 1899 and is based in Baltimore, Maryland.

The predecessor companies to Legg Mason trace back to Legg & Co., a Maryland-based broker-dealer formed in 1899.

In December 2005, Legg Mason completed a transaction in which it sold its primary broker-dealer businesses to concentrate on the asset management industry.  The asset management industry continues to experience disruption and challenges, including a shift to lower-fee passively managed products, increased fee pressure (including pressure arising from the shift to lower-fee passive products), regulatory changes, an increasing and changing role of technology in asset management services, the constant introduction of new products and services and the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisition. During fiscal year 2018, our focus on investing to improve lives and expanding client choice continued to drive strong sales, despite the ongoing trend of investor movement to passive strategies in certain portions of the industry.  During the course of this fiscal year, we expanded our investment offerings in response to demand for choice by:  offering new next generation products such as multi-asset class solutions and new vehicles, including the launch of six new exchange traded funds (""ETFs"");   completing a bolt-on acquisition adding new capabilities at Clarion Partners;   commercializing alternative products offered by our most recently acquired asset managers; 2   expanding our Alternative Distribution Strategies and Alternative Product teams with strategic hires; and   investing in technology to enhance our capabilities and expand choice for global investors.

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODIT TM , is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure, or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.  Our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Our initial target patient population is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group, which we estimate will reach approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018.  In late 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe, which we refer to as the PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) trial. We completed global enrollment of 554 patients between the ages of 4 and 49 in November 2016 and completed the final study for the PALISADE trial in December 2017. Patient demographics were generally balanced among patients ages 4-17 enrolled in the AR101 treatment arm as compared to those from the same age group enrolled in the placebo treatment arm.  After approximately one year of treatment, patients completed an exit double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Efficacy results for Intent-to-Treat, or ITT, group and for patients ages 4-17 who completed the AR101 treatment arm of the study, or Completers, are summarized in the charts below.  A total of 496 patients ages 4–17, from both arms (372 AR101 and 124 placebo), were evaluable for safety. An SAE is an adverse event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death, and must be reported to the FDA. A total of 10 patients ages 4-17 experienced SAEs, none of which were considered life-threatening: nine of these patients were in the AR101 arm (2.4%) and one was in the placebo arm (0.8%). Of the nine AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 that experienced an SAE, five patients experienced mild or moderate SAEs. The other four AR101-treated patients experienced severe SAEs, which, for two of these patients, were not related to treatment (a concussion and a viral asthmatic exacerbation). Of the two AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 who experienced severe SAEs related to treatment, both of whom had elevated baseline peanut-specific IgE levels greater than 100 kU/L, one experienced anaphylaxis and the other experienced wheezing on the first day of treatment. Of patients ages 4-17, 12.4% of patients from the AR101 treatment arm and 2.4% of patients from the placebo-treatment arm discontinued due to investigator-reported adverse events.  In January 2018, we completed enrollment of 506 patients in our real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial. In addition, in July 2017, we began enrollment of our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS	Yes

Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.	"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	Yes

The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $258.1 million, $243.0 million, and $264.9 million of total net sales for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $144.3 million, $176.2 million, and $250.0 million of revenues for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $63.3 million, $74.6 million, and $104.9 million of revenues for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $5.0 million, $4.6 million, and $5.9 million, for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	Yes

A bill to provide humanitarian relief to the Venezuelan people and Venezuelan migrants, to advance a constitutional and democratic solution to Venezuela's political crisis, to address Venezuela's economic reconstruction, to combat public corruption, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering, and for other purposes.	"Venezuela Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance, and Development Act of 2019 or the VERDAD Act of 2019

This bill directs the President to take various actions to address the political situation in Venezuela. (The United States does not recognize Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's President due to reports of widespread fraud during his election, recognizing instead National Assembly President Juan Guaido.)

The Department of State shall provide humanitarian aid to Venezuela and to Venezuelans in neighboring countries.

The bill imposes sanctions on foreign persons responsible for or complicit in corruption or activity undermining Venezuela's democratic institutions. Sanctions include barring entry into the United States and various financial restrictions.

The bill also (1) authorizes or imposes various sanctions targeting the Maduro regime's ability to finance debt, trade gold, and use cryptocurrencies; and (2) imposes visa-blocking sanctions on aliens acting on behalf of Russia to support Maduro regime security forces.

The bill directs the State Department to

 work with nongovernmental organizations to strengthen democratic governance and defend human rights in Venezuela, work with foreign governments to investigate corruption and recover assets stolen from Venezuela, and offer to help other countries establish legislative frameworks to impose sanctions on Maduro regime officials. The President shall engage with multilateral development banks to assist in rebuilding Venezuela's economy and energy infrastructure.

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to successfully commercialize our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") approved product, Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (""Rhopressa ® Rocklatan TM has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") goal date of March 14, 2019. TM (named Rhokiinsa® and Roclanda TM, respectively, in Europe) for regulatory approval in Europe and Japan and expect to commercialize on our own in Europe and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan, if approved. We are also focused on furthering the development of our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases and expect to have two preclinical implants, AR-1105 and AR-13503, commence clinical trials in 2019. Further, we are screening our owned library of Rho kinase (""ROCK"") inhibitors for indications beyond glaucoma.  Rhopressa® is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned ROCK inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Early indications point to healthcare professionals prescribing Rhopressa® as a concomitant therapy to prostaglandins or non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) medications when additional IOP reduction is desired. We believe Rhopressa® is primarily competing with other non-PGA products, due to its targeting of the diseased trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, its preferred once-daily dosing relative to other currently marketed non-PGA products and its safety profile. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  We launched Rhopressa® in the United States at the end of April 2018. Rhopressa® is now being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rhopressa® through pharmacies across the United States. In the glaucoma market in the United States, approximately half of the dispensed volumes are covered under commercial plans and half under Medicare Part D. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® for approximately 90% of lives covered under commercial plans and approximately 40% of lives covered under Medicare Part D plans. We expect Medicare Part D Tier 2 equivalent coverage to increase to over 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Rocklatan TM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Rocklatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Rocklatan TM, if approved and formulary coverage is obtained, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.  We submitted a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Rocklatan TM to the FDA in May 2018 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the ""FDCA""), which provides for an abbreviated approval pathway, since Rocklatan TM is a fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs in the United States. In July 2018, we announced that the NDA was accepted for review by the FDA and the PDUFA goal date was set for March 14, 2019.  Our strategy also includes developing our business outside the United States, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan."	No

The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.  The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972.

Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 1,000 tenants whose businesses include e-commerce, government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, and distribution. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 1,900 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.

Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary (""TRS""), a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted. As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.  We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.  All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties.

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 364 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks.  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2017 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates. Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables.	No

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	Yes

Aegion Corp.	"Aegion combines innovative technologies with market leading expertise to maintain, rehabilitate and strengthen pipelines and other infrastructure around the world. Since 1971, we have played a pioneering role in finding transformational solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure, primarily pipelines in the wastewater, water, energy, mining and refining industries. We also maintain the efficient operation of refineries and other industrial facilities and provide innovative solutions for the strengthening and increased longevity of buildings, bridges and other structures. We believe the depth and breadth of our products and services make us a leading provider for the world's infrastructure rehabilitation and protection needs.  Our Company premise is to use technology to extend the structural design life and maintain, if not improve, the performance of infrastructure, mostly pipelines and piping systems. We have proved this expertise can be applied in a variety of markets to protect pipelines in oil, gas, nuclear, power, utility, mining, wastewater and water applications and can be extended to the rehabilitation and maintenance of commercial structures and the provision of professional services in energy-related industries. Many types of infrastructure must be protected from the corrosive and abrasive materials that pass through or near them. Our expertise in non-disruptive corrosion engineering and abrasion protection is wide-ranging. We manufacture many of the engineered solutions we offer to customers as well as the specialized equipment required to install them. Finally, decades of experience give us an advantage in understanding municipal, utility, energy, mining, industrial and commercial customers. CIPP process served as the first trenchless technology for rehabilitating wastewater pipelines and has enabled municipalities and private industry to avoid the extraordinary expense and extreme disruption that can result from conventional ""dig-and-replace"" methods. We have maintained our leadership position in the CIPP market from manufacturing to technological innovations and market share for over 45 years.  We embarked on a diversification strategy in 2009 to expand not only our geographic reach but also our product and service portfolio into the oil and gas markets. Through a series of strategic initiatives and key acquisitions, we now possess a broad portfolio of cost-effective solutions for rehabilitating and maintaining aging or deteriorating infrastructure, protecting new infrastructure from corrosion and other threats, and providing integrated professional services in engineering, procurement, construction, maintenance and turnaround services for oil and natural gas companies, primarily in the midstream and 2 downstream markets. Today, our long-term strategy is to invest in our core end markets for organic growth and acquire innovative technologies to enhance our competitive position.  We have three operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: Infrastructure Solutions, Corrosion Protection and Energy Services. The majority of our work is performed in the municipal water and wastewater pipeline sector and, while the pace of growth is primarily driven by government funding and spending, overall demand due to required infrastructure improvements in our core markets should result in a long-term stable growth opportunity for our market leading products, Insituform® Corrosion Protection is positioned to capture the benefits of continued oil and natural gas pipeline infrastructure developments across North America and internationally, as producers and midstream pipeline companies transport their product from onshore and offshore oil and gas fields to regional demand centers. The segment has a broad portfolio of technologies, products and services to protect, maintain, rehabilitate, assess and monitor pipelines from the effects of corrosion, including cathodic protection, interior pipe linings, interior and exterior pipe coatings and inspection and repair capabilities, as well as an increasing offering of data management capabilities related to these services. We provide solutions to customers to enhance the safety, environmental integrity, reliability and compliance of their pipelines in the global transmission and distribution network, especially in the oil and gas markets.  We offer a unique value proposition based on our world-class safety and labor productivity programs, which allow us to provide cost-effective construction, maintenance, turnaround and specialty services at customers' refineries as well as chemical and other industrial facilities. We understand the demands and the level of critical planning required to ensure a successful turnaround or shutdown and offer a full range of services as part of our facility maintenance solutions, while maintaining a reputation for being safe, professional and providing predictable value.  We are committed to being a valued partner to our customers, with a constant focus on expanding those relationships by solving complex infrastructure problems, enhancing our capabilities and improving execution while also developing or acquiring innovative technologies and comprehensive services. The fundamental driver in the global municipal pipeline rehabilitation market is the growing gap between the need and current spend. While we do not expect the spending gap to close any time soon, the increasing need for pipeline rehabilitation supports a long-term sustainable market for the technologies and services offered by our Infrastructure Solutions segment."

A bill to create protections for depository institutions that provide financial services to cannabis-related legitimate businesses and service providers for such businesses, and for other purposes.	"Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2019 or the SAFE Banking Act of 2019

This bill generally prohibits a federal banking regulator from penalizing a depository institution for providing banking services to a legitimate marijuana-related business.

A bill to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit anticompetitive behaviors by drug product manufacturers, and for other purposes.	Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 This bill prohibits patent thicketing and product hopping by drug manufacturers. In general, patent thicketing occurs when a drug manufacturer obtains new patents related to a previously-patented drug, biological product, or underlying chemical composition that extends the manufacturer’s market exclusivity for that drug without demonstrating that the new patents serve a meaningful purpose other than limiting competition from generic drug manufacturers. Product hopping is presumed when a drug manufacturer obtains removal of a drug from the Food and Drug Administration’s approved drug list, discontinues a drug, or markets a reformulation of an already-approved drug during a certain period after which the manufacturer has been notified that a competing drug manufacturer has applied for generic drug approval. These practices are not considered product hopping if the manufacturer demonstrates that the drug was removed from the approved-drug list for safety reasons. Or, in the case of a drug reformulation, the manufacturer shows that the modified product provides a significant health benefit, is the option least likely to reduce competition, and is based on substantial financial considerations unrelated to limiting competition. The Federal Trade Commission may penalize violating manufacturers and bring claims in federal court to prohibit the conduct and provide restitution.	8x8, Inc.

From one proprietary cloud technology platform, customers have access to unified communications, team collaboration, video conferencing, contact center, data and analytics and other services.  Unlike our cloud communication competitors, 8x8 owns its complete technology stack, built over twenty years of company investment and supported by over 170 technology patents. Our cloud communications and collaboration solutions are designed for easy deployment, management, and use, operating across multiple devices and locations for any business workflow or global environment. Built from core cloud technologies that we own and manage internally, our solution enables 8x8 customers to rely on one provider for their global communications, video meetings, contact center and customer support requirements.  The 8x8 technology platform provides customers with key technology integrations within their existing infrastructure. Companies are looking to increase their competitive edge by integrating their communications with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Human Capital Management (HCM) applications, and other back-office IT (information technology) systems within their infrastructure. Further complicating matters, business users are circumventing their IT departments by using a variety of self-selected third-party tools for team communication and collaboration, driving a shift in the buying center for communications and collaboration from IT to individuals, a phenomenon known in the industry as ""shadow IT. "" 8x8 integrates across CRM/ERP (such as Netsuite or Bullhorn), service and support (such as Zendesk or Salesforce sales cloud), and other productivity/collaboration tools (slack or G-suite, for example), providing seamless access, unified analytics, and business flexibility to 8x8 customers. This is supported by 8x8 through its data security and compliance certifications, including HIPAA, FISMA and ISO 27001,which meet or exceed the requirements of government and industry agencies around the world.  Many other legacy business processes have already experienced the move to the cloud phenomenon. Examples include companies using legacy front office applications switching to cloud providers like Salesforce.com, Inc., or the use of IT management applications migrating to industry disruptors such as Servicenow, Inc. Business communications applications are following suit as the next major business segment to migrate to the cloud. Businesses today face increasing cost and complexity with deployments of communications and collaboration solutions. Companies of all sizes are managing a global, distributed workforce that seeks to leverage multiple forms of communication in their day-to-day interactions. The rapid rise of mobile devices in the enterprise has created demand for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) integration as part of a typical business' communications needs. We believe that 8x8 is an industry disruptor (in the same vein as Salesforce was for front office applications or Servicenow was for IT applications), across three large markets: unified communications, video meeting solutions, and contact center applications. Our platform, which offers capabilities and functionality across all three areas in one integrated technology stack provides a complete cloud offering that enhances productivity and business insight. Combining these services allows our customers to eliminate information silos and expose vital, real-time communications data spanning multiple services, applications and devices which, in turn, can improve productivity, business performance and customer experience.  Traditionally, small businesses were the first to transition their communications to the cloud starting several years ago, due to cost effectiveness, ease of deployment and inherent flexibility."	No

The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the world's largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express.

Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject 3 to annual adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company, and, in some cases, the Company owns or leases some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA, and leases or subleases, as applicable, such aircraft to the regional carrier.  In return, the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such CPA exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus® loyalty program.

Alphabet, Inc.	That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history -- inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with Android and map the world with Google Maps. Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which is Google. It also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main internet products in areas such as self-driving cars, life sciences, internet access and TV services. The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. So whether you're a child in a rural village or a professor at an elite university, you can access the same information. We are helping people get online by tailoring digital experiences to the needs of emerging markets. For instance, our digital payments app in India, now called Google Pay, helps tens of millions of people and businesses easily pay with just a few taps. We're also making sure our core Google products are fast and useful, especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns.  For instance, Loon announced that it will bring its balloon-powered internet to regions of central Kenya, starting in 2019.  People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more useful -- it's what allows you to use your voice to ask the Google Assistant for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to see better YouTube recommendations, and to search for people and events in Google Photos. Our advertising tools also use machine learning to help marketers find the right audience, deliver the right creative, and optimize their campaigns through better auto-bidding and measurement tools. Machine learning is also showing great promise in helping us tackle big issues, like dramatically improving the energy efficiency of our data centers.  Across Other Bets, machine learning helps self-driving cars better detect and respond to others on the road, assists delivery drones in determining whether a location is safe for drop off, and can also help clinicians more accurately detect sight-threatening eye diseases.  We have always been a company committed to building products that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google's core products and platforms such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation 3  that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems. As the majority of Alphabet's big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus that we' Instead of just showing ten blue links in our search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for. You can also type or talk with the Google Assistant in a conversational way across multiple devices like phones, speakers, headphones, televisions and more. And with Google Lens, you can use your phone's camera to identify an unfamiliar landmark or find a trailer from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily -- like Google Maps, which helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos.

Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.

Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

Consumer Health Options and Insurance Competition Enhancement Act or the CHOICE Act This bill requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to develop a public health insurance option that meets all federal plan requirements and is available on state and federal health insurance exchanges. Specifically, the CMS must offer silver and gold plans, may offer bronze plans, and must include all essential benefits, consumer protections, and cost-sharing limitations in each plan. The CMS may contract with a third party to administer the public option plans and states may establish advisory councils to make recommendations to the CMS about the operation and policies of such plans. Further, the CMS must establish geographically adjusted premiums and negotiate provider payment rates for services and prescription drugs covered the plans. If a payment rate cannot be negotiated, the CMS must pay the amount for such service as required under traditional Medicare. Medicare and Medicaid providers are automatically participants in public option plans unless they opt out, and providers not participating in Medicare or Medicaid may opt in.	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 with the recommended dosing of 34 mg once a day taken as two 17 mg tablets. In June 2018, the FDA approved a 34 mg NUPLAZID capsule formulation that provides patients with the recommended 34 mg once daily dose in a single, small capsule, reducing patient pill burden compared to the previous administration of two 17 mg tablets. In addition, the FDA approved a 10 mg NUPLAZID tablet for patients concomitantly receiving strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, which can inhibit the metabolizing of NUPLAZID .  We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we are continuing to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis is one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we 1 announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 s tudy exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency , we initiated our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementi Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, major depressive disorder, or MDD, affects approximately 16 million adults in the United States, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy. In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in 207 patients with MDD who had a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line, SSRI or SNRI, antidepressant therapy. In the study, pimavanserin met the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and positive results were also observed in seven additional secondary endpoints including response rate, improvement in sexual function, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness. Pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated in the study with no meaningful weight gain or impact on motor function observed. In February 2019, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program for pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in the first half of 2019.  We also believe schizophrenia is a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address certain important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms.

Our Strategy and Vision Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.  We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports and film and television content.  Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.  Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental  ""in-game"" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we have begun to generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products.

This bill establishes a test for determining if a service provider should be classified as an independent contractor rather than as an employee for tax purposes.

If the requirements of the test are met, the provider may not be treated as an employee, the recipient or any payor may not be treated as an employer, and compensation for the service may not be treated as paid or received with respect to employment.

The factors of the test include

 the relationship between the parties (i.e., the provider incurs expenses; does not work exclusively for a single recipient; performs the service for a particular amount of time, to achieve a specific result, or to complete a specific task; or is a sales person compensated primarily on a commission basis); the place of business or ownership of the equipment (i.e., the provider has a principal place of business, does not work primarily at the recipient's place of business, and provides tools or supplies); and the performance of the services under a written contract that meets certain requirements (i.e., specifies that the provider is not an employee, the recipient will satisfy withholding and reporting requirements, and that the provider is responsible for taxes on the compensation). The bill also (1) sets forth withholding and reporting requirements for service recipients who meet the requirements of the test, and (2) allows service providers to petition the U.S. Tax Court for a determination of employment status."	AGNC Investment Corp.	"We fund our investments primarily through borrowings structured as repurchase agreements.  We operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (""REIT"") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code""). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable income. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.  We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (""Agency RMBS"") on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (""Fannie Mae"") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (""Freddie Mac,"" and together with Fannie Mae, the ""GSEs""), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (""Ginnie Mae""). We may also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency or in other investments in, or related to, the housing, mortgage or real estate markets.  remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ""Investment Company Act"").  Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates representing interests in ""pools"" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect  ""passed through"" to the security holders, after deducting GSE or U.S. Government agency guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), which are structured instruments representing interests in Agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific Agency CMO securities.  TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.  CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third-party; rather, ""credit risk transfer"" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. The reduced amount that issuers are obligated to repay to the security holders offsets the issuer's credit losses on the related pool of loans.  Non-Agency RMBS are securities backed by residential mortgages, for which payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of RMBS. Non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Residential non-Agency securities are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or nonprime mortgage loans."	Yes

Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018. After the adoption of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion, we expect a final decision regarding the MAA from the European Commission before the end of 2019.

In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018.
