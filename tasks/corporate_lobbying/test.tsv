400	A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"At Adamas Pharmaceuticals, Inc., we seek to redefine the treatment experience for patients suffering from chronic neurological diseases. Our vision is grand, our goal bold: to create and commercialize a new generation of medicines intended to lessen the burden of disease on patients, caregivers and society. With a new commercial medicine and robust pipeline of investigational programs focused on meaningfully differentiated treatment options for patients, we believe we are well on our way. Our therapeutic targets include a broad range of neurologic diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease.  Our treatment innovations stem from a deep scientific understanding of time-dependent biology – the deliberate mapping of disease patterns and drug activity – along with a goal to meaningfully increase the efficacy of known molecules without compromising tolerability. This approach is designed to ensure that our medicines fit within, rather than define, people's daily lives. Our goal is to develop medicines that are timed for the benefit of patients.  Our understanding of time-dependent biological processes informs our every innovation, targeting advancement in treatment of chronic neurologic disorders.

This bill prohibits state Medicaid programs from covering conversion therapy. The bill defines conversion therapy as any practice or treatment that seeks to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity in exchange for monetary compensation."	Abeona Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.	1

Verso Corp.	"Verso is the sole member of Verso Holding LLC, which is the sole member of Verso Paper Holding LLC. As used in this report, the term ""Verso Holding"" refers to Verso Holding LLC, and the term ""Verso Paper"" refers to Verso Paper Holding LLC.  We are the leading North American producer of coated papers, which are used primarily in commercial print, magazines, catalogs, high-end advertising brochures and annual reports, among other media and marketing publications.  We produce a wide range of products, ranging from coated freesheet and coated groundwood, to specialty papers, packaging papers, inkjet and digital papers, supercalendered papers and uncoated freesheet.  We also produce and sell bleached and unbleached market kraft pulp, which is used to manufacture paper and packaging products.  The mills have an aggregate annual production capacity of approximately 1,970,000 tons of paper.  We sell and market our products to approximately 300 customers which comprise approximately 1,300 end-user accounts. We have long-standing relationships with many leading magazine and catalog publishers, commercial printers, specialty retail merchandisers and paper merchants. We reach our end-users through several distribution channels, including direct sales, commercial printers, paper merchants and brokers.  whereby we agreed to sell to Pixelle, or the ""Pixelle Sale,"" all of the outstanding membership interests in Verso Androscoggin, LLC an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Verso and the entity that, as of the closing date, held all the assets primarily related to Verso's Androscoggin Mill located in Jay, Maine, and Stevens Point Mill, located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The consideration for the sale will be subject to final post-closing adjustments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Pixelle Sale reduced the aggregate annual production capacity of our mills by approximately 660,000 tons. On April 30, 2019, we announced the permanent shutdown of our paper mill in Luke, Maryland in response to the continuing decline in customer demand for the grades of coated freesheet paper produced at the Luke Mill, along with rising input costs, a significant influx of imports and rising compliance costs and infrastructure challenges associated with environmental regulation. The shutdown of the Luke Mill reduced our coated freesheet production capacity by approximately 450,000 tons and eliminated approximately 675 positions at the Luke Mill.  Based on total industry 2019 sales and other market research, we estimate the size of the global coated paper industry to be approximately 35 million tons, including approximately 5 million tons in North America. Coated paper is used primarily in media and marketing applications, including catalogs, magazines and commercial printing applications, which include high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct mail advertising. Demand is generally driven by North American advertising and print media trends, which in turn have historically been correlated with growth in gross domestic product. The coated paper industry has been facing a decline in demand driven primarily by the growth in digital media (see ""Item 1A. - The paper industry has been facing a long-term structural decline and our profitability has been adversely impacted by such decline"").  In North America, coated papers are classified by brightness and fall into five grades, labeled No. 1 to No. 5, with No. 1 having the highest brightness level and No. 5 having the lowest brightness level. Papers graded No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 are typically coated freesheet grades. No. 4 and No. 5 papers are predominantly grades containing groundwood. Coated groundwood grades are the preferred grades for catalogs and magazines, while coated freesheet is more commonly used in commercial print applications.  Within the paper industry, specialty papers are products which are given unique characteristics in their manufacturing, converting or processing and that have properties suitable for special purposes or custom engineered applications. Specialty papers have unique functional properties and are usually produced in relatively small quantities for a specific product, function or end-use requirement."	0

Prologis, Inc.	"Business Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Internal Revenue Code""). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. We operate and evaluate our business on an owned and managed (""O & M"") basis, including properties that we wholly-own and properties that are owned by one of our co-investment ventures. We make decisions based on the property operations, regardless of our ownership interest. Our investment consists of our wholly-owned properties and our pro rata (or ownership) share of the properties owned in ventures.  THE COMPANY Prologis is the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on key markets in 19 countries on four continents. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing and property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions allowing us to recycle capital to self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategies, we have integrated the properties while adding minimal property management expenses .

(i) the restructuring of our in-house global digital commerce platform which was in development and shifting to a more cost-effective, flexible platform through a new agreement with Salesforce's Commerce Cloud, formerly known as Demandware; (ii) the closure of our Polo store at 711 Fifth Avenue in New York City; and (iii) the further streamlining of the organization and the execution of other key corporate actions in line with the Way Forward Plan."	0
411	To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, a cure.	Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.	Abeona Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.	1

413	A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Additionally, for one year after a drug is provided under a competitive license, such drug is also subject to specified price limitations; if the drug is not offered at such prices, the drug is subject to additional licensing that furthers its sale under any federal program (e.g., Medicaid)."	ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders.

415	A bill to significantly lower prescription drug prices for patients in the United States by ending government-granted monopolies for manufacturers who charge drug prices that are higher than the median prices at which the drugs are available in other countries.	"Prescription Drug Price Relief Act of 2019

This bill establishes a series of oversight and disclosure requirements relating to the prices of brand-name drugs. Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review at least annually all brand-name drugs for excessive pricing; HHS must also review prices upon petition. If any such drugs are found to be excessively priced, HHS must (1) void any government-granted exclusivity; (2) issue open, nonexclusive licenses for the drugs; and (3) expedite the review of corresponding applications for generic drugs and biosimilar biological products. HHS must also create a public database with its determinations for each drug.

Under the bill, a price is considered excessive if the domestic average manufacturing price exceeds the median price for the drug in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Japan. If a price does not meet this criteria, or if pricing information is unavailable in at least three of the aforementioned countries, the price is still considered excessive if it is higher than reasonable in light of specified factors, including cost, revenue, and the size of the affected patient population.

The bill also requires drug manufacturers to report specified financial information for brand-name drugs, including research and advertising expenditures."	Abeona Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Our lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV NAGLU), an AAV based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB). We are also developing ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR /Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases. In addition we are developing a proprietary vector platform, AIM™, for next generation product candidates. Product Development Strategy Abeona is focused on developing and delivering gene therapy products for severe and life-threatening rare diseases. A rare disease is one that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. There are nearly 7,000 rare diseases, which may involve chronic illness, disability, and often, premature death. While rare diseases can affect any age group, about 50% of people affected are children (15 million) and rare diseases account for 35% of deaths in the first year of life. Over 95% of rare diseases do not have a single FDA or EMA approved drug treatment, however most rare diseases are often caused by changes in genes. We believe emerging insights in genetics and advances in biotechnology, as well as new approaches and collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators and patient groups, provide significant opportunities to develop breakthrough treatments for rare diseases.  Next Generation Gene Therapy Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a potential therapy to treat a disease. In many disorders, particularly genetic diseases caused by a single genetic defect, gene therapy aims to treat a disease by delivering the correct copy of DNA into a patient's cells. The healthy, functional copy of the therapeutic gene then helps the cell function correctly. In gene therapy, DNA that encodes a therapeutic protein is packaged within a ''vector,'' often ' virus, which is used to transfer the DNA to the inside of cells within the body. Gene therapy can be delivered by a direct injection, either intravenously (IV) or directly into a specific tissue in the body, where it is taken up by individual cells. Once inside cells, the correct DNA is expressed by the cell machinery, resulting in the production of missing or defective protein, which in turn is used to treat the patient's underlying disease and can provide long-term benefit.  Viruses such as AAV are utilized because they have evolved a way of encapsulating and delivering one or more genes of the size needed for clinical application, and can be purified in large quantities at high concentration. Unlike AAV vectors found in nature, the AAV vectors used by Abeona have been genetically-modified such that they do not replicate. Although the preclinical studies in animal models of disease demonstrate the promising impact of AAV-mediated gene expression to affected tissues such as the heart, liver and muscle, our programs use a specific virus that is capable of delivering therapeutic DNA across the blood brain barrier and into the central nervous system (CNS) and the somatic system (body), making them attractive for addressing lysosomal storage diseases which have severe CNS manifestations of the disease.  Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of rare inborn errors of metabolism resulting from deficiency in normal lysosomal function. These diseases are characterized by progressive accumulation of storage material within the lysosomes of affected cells, ultimately leading to cellular dysfunction. Multiple tissues ranging from musculoskeletal and visceral to tissues of the CNS are typically involved in disease pathology. Since the advent of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) to manage some LSDs, general clinical outcomes have significantly improved; however, treatment with infused protein is lifelong and continued disease progression is still evident in patients.	1

As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional operations. With key global aviation rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, UAL has the worlds most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500 flights a day to 338 airports across five continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (Newark), Chicago OHare International Airport (Chicago OHare), The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The 3 hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the worlds largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (Republic), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (CommutAir), ExpressJet Airlines (ExpressJet), GoJet Airlines (GoJet), Mesa Airlines (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines (SkyWest), Air Wisconsin Airlines (Air Wisconsin), and Trans States Airlines (Trans States) are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (CPAs). Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject to annual inflation adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus ® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2018, Star Alliance carriers served 1,300 airports in 191 countries with 18,400 daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, Avianca Brasil, Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Air Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines. United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carriers selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul, Cape Air, Eurowings, Great Lakes Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Silver Airways. In addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air partners, United also offers a train-to-plane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark on select city pairs in the northeastern United States.  United also participates in three passenger joint ventures, one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes and one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand. These passenger joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. United has also implemented cargo joint 4 ventures with ANA for transpacific cargo services and continues to implement a cargo joint venture with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services. These cargo joint ventures offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers respective combined networks. 	0

Addus HomeCare Corp.	"We are a home care services provider operating in three segments: personal care; hospice; and home health. Our services are principally provided in the home under agreements with federal, state and local government agencies. Our consumers are predominantly ""dual eligible,"" meaning they are eligible to receive both Medicare and Medicaid benefits.  As of December 31, 2018, we provided services to over 39,000 consumers in 24 states through 156 offices. Our payor clients include federal, state and local governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers and private individuals. Our personal care segment also includes staffing services, with clients including assisted living facilities, nursing homes and hospice facilities.  Our services and operating model address a number of crucial needs across the healthcare continuum. Care provided in the home generally costs less than facility-based care and is typically preferred by consumers and their families. By providing services in the home to the elderly and others who require long-term care and support with the activities of daily living, we lower the cost of chronic and acute care treatment by delaying or eliminating the need for care in more expensive settings. In addition, our caregivers observe and report changes in the condition of our consumers for the purpose of facilitating early intervention in the disease process, which often reduces the cost of medical services by preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and/or hospital admissions and re-admissions. We coordinate the services provided by our team with those of other healthcare providers and payors as appropriate. By providing care in the preferred setting of the home and by providing opportunities to improve the consumer's conditions and allow early intervention as indicated, our model also is designed to improve consumer outcomes and satisfaction.  We believe our model provides significant value to managed care organizations. States are increasingly implementing managed care programs for Medicaid enrollees, and as a result managed care organizations have been increasingly responsible for the healthcare needs and the related healthcare costs of our consumers. Managed care organizations have an economic incentive to better manage the healthcare expenditures of their members, lower costs and improve outcomes. We believe that our model is well positioned to assist in meeting those goals while also improving consumer satisfaction, and, as a result, we expect increased referrals from managed care organizations.  Beginning January 1, 2019, a final rule of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (""CMS""), allows Medicare Advantage insurers to offer beneficiaries more options and new benefits. Through this rule, CMS has redefined health-related supplemental benefits to include services that increase health and improve quality of life, including coverage of non-skilled in-home care. This policy change, emphasizing improving quality and reducing costs, aligns with our overall approach to care, and we believe the increased demand for personal care from the Medicare Advantage population represents a significant upside opportunity over the next three to five years.  We utilize Interactive Voice Response (""IVR"") systems and smart phone applications to communicate with the majority of our aides. Through these technologies, our aides are able to report changes in health conditions to an appropriate manager for triage and evaluation. In addition, we use these technologies to record basic information about each visit, record start and end times for a 2 scheduled shift, track milea ge reimbursement, send text messages to the aide and communicate basic payroll information. In addition to our organic growth, we have been growing through acquisitions that have expanded our presence in current markets or facilitated our entry into new ma rkets where the personal care business has primarily been moving to managed care organizations.  We maintain licensure as a Medicare home health agency in Ohio and Delaware in connection with providing services in those states. With the purchase of Ambercare Corporation (""Ambercare""), completed in the second quarter of 2018, we now maintain licensure as a Medicare home health and hospice agency in New Mexico. "	0

Forward-looking statements include our statements regarding future expense, capacity growth, expected capital expenditures, number of contracted aircraft to be placed in service in the future, future expansion of our golf management and family entertainment center businesses, the development and financing of our Sunseeker Resort, as well as other information concerning future results of operations, business strategies, financing plans, competitive position, industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of future regulation and the effects of competition. We are a leisure travel company focused on providing travel services and products to residents of under-served cities in the United States. Our unique business model provides diversified revenue streams from various travel services and product offerings which distinguish us from other travel companies. We operate a low-cost passenger airline marketed primarily to leisure travelers in under-served cities, allowing us to sell air transportation both on a stand-alone basis and bundled with the sale of air-related and third party services and products. In addition, we provide air transportation under fixed fee flight arrangements. Our developed route network, pricing philosophy, advertising, and product offerings built around relationships with premier leisure companies, are all intended to appeal to leisure travelers and make it attractive for them to purchase air travel and related services and products from us.  Most recently, and in conjunction with our leisure travel focus, we are developing Sunseeker Resort in Florida, operating a golf course near the resort location, managing a golf course management solution and beginning to open family entertainment centers in cities in our route network.  Below is a brief description of the travel services and products we provide to our customers: Scheduled service air transportation.  We provide scheduled air transportation on limited-frequency, nonstop flights predominantly between under-served cities and popular leisure destinations. As of that date, we were selling travel on 450 routes to 122 cities. We provide unbundled air-related services and products in conjunction with air transportation for an additional cost to customers. These optional air-related services and products include baggage fees, advance seat assignments, our own travel protection product, change fees, use of our call center for purchases, priority 4 boarding, a customer convenience fee, food and beverage purchases on board, and other air-related services. The revenue for ancillary air-related products and services is reflected in the Passenger revenue income statement line item, along with scheduled service air transportation revenue.  We offer third party travel products such as hotel rooms and ground transportation (rental cars and hotel shuttle products) for sale to our passengers. The marketing component of revenue related to our co-branded credit card is also accounted for in this category.  We provide air transportation through fixed fee agreements and charter service on a year-round and ad-hoc basis.  We may choose to temporarily act as a lessor as an avenue to opportunistically acquire aircraft and/or engines. We are also currently leasing spare engines to a third party and may choose to act as lessor temporarily in the future on an opportunistic basis. This line item also includes revenue from our golf course acquired in 2018 and our management solution to golf courses around the country.  We have developed a unique business model that focuses on leisure travelers in small and medium-sized cities. The business model has evolved as our experienced management team has looked differently at the traditional way business has been conducted in the airline and travel industries. Our focus on the leisure customer allows us to eliminate the significant costs associated with serving a wide variety of customers and to concentrate our product appeal on a customer base which is under-served by traditional airlines. Unbundled pricing of air-related services and products By unbundling our air-related services and products such as baggage fees, advance seat assignments, travel protection, change fees, priority boarding, and food and beverage purchases , we are able to lower our airfares and target leisure travelers who are more concerned with price and the ability to customize their experience with us by only purchasing the additional conveniences they value. We have established a route network with a national footprint, providing service on 405 routes (and currently selling 450 routes) between 99 origination cities and 23 leisure destinations, and serving 42 states and Puerto Rico as of February 15, 2019.	0

Acceleron Pharma, Inc.	"We are a leading biopharmaceutical company in the discovery and development of TGF-beta superfamily therapeutics to treat serious and rare diseases. Our research focuses on key natural regulators of cellular growth and repair, particularly the Transforming Growth Factor-Beta, or TGF-beta, protein superfamily. By combining our discovery and development expertise, including our proprietary knowledge of the TGF-beta superfamily, and our internal protein engineering and manufacturing capabilities, we have generated several innovative therapeutic candidates, all of which encompass novel potential first-in-class mechanisms of action. We have focused and prioritized our research and development activities within three key therapeutic areas: hematologic, neuromuscular and pulmonary. If successful, these candidates could have the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes for patients across these areas of high, unmet need.  Luspatercept, our lead program, and sotatercept, are partnered with Celgene Corporation, or Celgene. Luspatercept is an investigational erythroid maturation agent designed to promote red blood cell production through a novel mechanism, and is being developed to treat chronic anemia and associated complications in myelodysplastic syndromes, or MDS, beta-thalassemia, and myelofibrosis. In 2018, we and Celgene announced positive results for two Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept; one for the treatment of patients with lower-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, known as the MEDALIST trial, and another for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, also known as the BELIEVE trial. In the MEDALIST trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence of at least 8 consecutive weeks during the first 24 weeks compared to placebo. In the BELIEVE trial, luspatercept achieved a highly statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of erythroid response, which was defined as at least a 33 percent reduction from baseline in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion burden with a reduction of at least 2 units during the protocol-defined period of 12 consecutive weeks, from week 13 to week 24, compared to placebo. Results from the MEDALIST and BELIEVE trials were then presented during plenary and oral sessions, respectively, at the 60th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2018, and we expect to submit these results for publication during 2019. ""Best of ASH,"" chosen from among the thousands of meeting abstracts as  ""the biggest breakthroughs from the meeting's scientific presentations. We and Celgene are planning regulatory application submissions for luspatercept in both MDS and beta-thalassemia in the United States in April 2019 and in Europe in the first half of 2019.  In addition to the MEDALIST and BELIEVE Phase 3 clinical trials with luspatercept, Celgene is currently conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial in non-transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia patients, referred to as the BEYOND trial, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in 2020. Celgene has also initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial, the COMMANDS trial, in first-line, lower-risk MDS patients and enrollment is ongoing. Enrollment is also currently ongoing in a Phase 2 clinical trial being conducted by Celgene for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder, with preliminary top-line results currently expected in the second half of 2019. If luspatercept were to receive regulatory approval for each of these indications in the United States and Europe, we believe that there is an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $2 billion across the indications in the BEYOND trial and the luspatercept Phase 3 clinical trials, and an annual peak sales opportunity for luspatercept in excess of $1 billion in myelofibrosis. We and Celgene are also evaluating further research of luspatercept for the treatment of anemia in potential new indications that could provide additional sales opportunities.  For sotatercept, we have the rights to fund, develop, and lead the global commercialization of sotatercept in pulmonary hypertension, which we refer to as the PH field, including pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. PAH is a rare and chronic, rapidly progressing disorder characterized by the constriction of small pulmonary arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. We are currently enrolling the PULSAR Phase 2 clinical trial of sotatercept for the treatment of patients with PAH with preliminary results expected in the first half of 2020, and we recently initiated an exploratory study, called SPECTRA, in the first quarter of 2019 to provide us with further understanding of sotatercept's impact on PAH. If sotatercept is commercialized to treat PAH and we recognize such revenue, then Celgene will be eligible to receive a royalty in the low 20% range on global net sales. For luspatercept and, outside of the PH field, sotatercept, Celgene is responsible for paying 100% of the development costs for all clinical trials. ACE-083 is designed for the treatment of focal muscle disorders, and we are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials with ACE-083 in patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD, as well as in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, or CMT."	0

We are an immunotherapy company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies that transform the treatment of challenging diseases, including cancer. We believe our three technology platforms are uniquely positioned to recruit and direct the immune system by activating cancer-fighting immune cells and inhibiting immune suppressive cells known to allow tumor growth. Product candidates from our STING Pathway Activator, B-select monoclonal antibody, and LADD, or Live, Attenuated, Double-Deleted Listeria monocytogenes platforms are designed to stimulate and/or regulate innate and adaptive immune responses, either as single agents or in combination with conventional therapies (i.e. chemotherapy and radiation) as well as other novel immunotherapies. Our diverse technology platforms have led to a strong pipeline of clinical and preclinical candidates, which are being developed for a number of cancer indications. Additionally, our platforms have the potential to generate product candidates that address other therapeutic areas, such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.  Immuno-oncology is an emerging field of cancer therapy that aims to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment to create and enhance anti-tumor immune responses, as well as to overcome the immuno-suppressive mechanisms that cancer cells have developed against the immune system. Recent developments in the field of immuno-oncology, including checkpoint inhibitors—therapies which work to remove suppression mechanisms that prevent an immune response against cancer cells—have shown the potential to provide efficacy and extended survival, even in cancers where conventional therapies, such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, have failed. The immunotherapy field is rapidly advancing with new immuno-oncology combinations that focus on strengthening therapeutic efficacy in a wide range of cancers. We intend to pursue a broad strategy of combining our technology platforms with conventional and novel therapies, based on their mechanisms of action, safety profiles and versatility.  Our STING Pathway Activator platform is designed to activate the intracellular Stimulator of Interferon Genes, or STING, receptor, resulting in a potent tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 is the first STING Pathway Activator compound to enter the clinic and is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 studies both as a monotherapy and in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in patients with cutaneously accessible metastatic solid tumors or lymphomas. Our B-select monoclonal antibody platform includes a proprietary ultra-selective functional screening process to identify antibodies with unique binding properties against a broad range of targets that are being designed to modulate the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Our most advanced product candidate from the B-select platform, BION-1301, is being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in mulitiple myeloma. In addition, the B-select platform has delivered a number of immune modulating assets currently in research and preclinical development. Our LADD technology platform is based on proprietary attenuated strains of Listeria that have been engineered to express tumor-associated antigens to induce specific and targeted immune responses. Our LADD program is focused on the development of personalized LADD, or pLADD, therapeutics that encode and express antigens that are based on protein sequences that result from mutations specific to an individual patient's tumor (neoantigens). These antigens can be also derived from native protein sequences that are highly expressed in patients with certain tumor types (self antigens).  We are developing a pipeline of proprietary product candidates on our own and have a number of collaborations with leading global pharmaceutical companies to expand our products and technology platforms. We are developing STING Activator product candidates in oncology under our worldwide collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and an anti-CD27 antibody was developed with and is exclusively licensed to, Merck Sharp and Dohme B.V., or Merck. In addition, we have developed self antigen-based LADD product candidates targeting lung and prostate cancers that are licensed to Janssen Biotech Inc., or Janssen. We believe our technology platforms – STING Pathway Activators, B-select monoclonal antibodies and LADD - represent innovative approaches in immuno-oncology. Since our product candidates act by leveraging the patient's own immune system, we believe they have the potential to deliver enhanced efficacy and to be safer and more tolerable than existing therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Based on the mechanisms of action and safety profiles of our technology platforms, we intend to build a deep pipeline of product candidates that can be readily combinable and synergistic with both conventional and novel therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors. Our vision is to utilize our scientific expertise and understanding of the body's natural defense systems, including the interplay between the innate and adaptive immune responses, to develop safe and effective therapies for the benefit of patients.  The STING receptor is known to be a central mediator of innate immunity and is critical for immune surveillance and control of cancer progression.	0

The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.  Our Midstream Business was started by Kingfisher on January 30, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating midstream oil and gas assets. We primarily focus on providing crude oil gathering, gas gathering and processing and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate in the STACK play. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 308 miles of existing low and high pressure pipelines, a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, 10 MMcf/d in offtake processing, compression facilities, crude storage, NGL storage and purchasing and marketing capabilities.  Our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling and gas gathering in the STACK.

"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	0
430	To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to promote access to life-saving therapies for Medicaid enrollees by ensuring coverage of routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in qualifying clinical trials, and for other purposes.	"Covering Life-saving Investigations Needed in Cancer and Other Life-threatening Conditions through Timely use of Resources for Easy and Affordable Treatment from Medicaid for Enrollees in Need Today Act or the CLINICAL TREATMENT Act

This bill requires state Medicaid programs to cover routine patient costs for items and services that are provided in connection with a qualifying clinical trial regarding cancer or other life-threatening conditions.

The bill defines ""routine patient costs"" to include items and services that would otherwise be covered under Medicaid absent the patient's participation in the clinical trial; the term includes items and services relating to trial complications, but excludes those items and services that are the subject of the trial or that are provided solely in relation to data analysis.

Additionally, a ""qualifying clinical trial"" means, among other things, a clinical trial that is approved or funded by specified entities (e.g., the National Institutes of Health) or is an authorized new drug trial."	Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the fundamental transformation of patients'  lives through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism, with the goal of making transformative, first- or best-in-class medicines. Our therapeutic areas of focus are cancer and rare genetic diseases, or RGDs, which are diseases that are directly caused by changes in genes or chromosomes, often passed from one generation to the next. The incidence of a single RGD can vary widely but is generally very infrequent, usually equal to or less than one per 100,000 births. In both areas of cancer and RGDs, we are seeking to unlock the biology of cellular metabolism as a platform to create transformative therapies.  Our first commercial cancer product is IDHIFA®. In August 2017, the FDA granted our collaboration partner Celgene Corporation, or Celgene, approval of IDHIFA® for the treatment of adult patients with R/R AML, and an IDH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. IDHIFA®, an oral targeted inhibitor of the mutated IDH2 enzyme, is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with R/R AML and an IDH2 mutation.  Our most advanced clinical cancer product candidates are ivosidenib, which targets mutated IDH1, and AG-881, which is a brain-penetrant pan-IDH mutant inhibitor. In December 2017, we submitted a new drug application, or NDA, to the FDA for ivosidenib for the treatment of patients with R/R AML and an IDH1 mutation. We plan to submit an MAA to the EMA for ivosidenib for IDH1 mutant-positive R/R AML in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Our next most advanced cancer product candidate is AG-270, an inhibitor of MAT2A. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for AG-270 in November 2017, and in December 2017 the FDA concluded that we may proceed with our planned phase 1 dose-escalation trial of AG-270 in multiple tumor types carrying a methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, or MTAP, deletion. We expect to initiate this trial in the first quarter of 2018.  Our most advanced preclinical cancer product candidate is an inhibitor of the metabolic enzyme DHODH. We plan to submit an IND for our DHODH inhibitor for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The lead product candidate in our RGD program, AG-348, targets pyruvate kinase-R for the treatment of pyruvate kinase, or PK, deficiency. PK deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that often results in severe hemolytic anemia, jaundice and lifelong conditions associated with chronic anemia and secondary complications due to inherited mutations in the pyruvate kinase enzyme within red blood cells, or RBCs. We intend to initiate two global, pivotal trials of AG-348 in PK deficiency in the first half of 2018: ACTIVATE-T, a single arm trial of approximately 20 regularly transfused patients, is expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2018, and ACTIVATE, a 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial of approximately 80 patients who do not receive regular transfusions, is expected to initiate in the second quarter of 2018. We also expect to initiate a phase 2 proof of concept trial of AG-348 in thalassemia in the fourth quarter of 2018.  In addition to the aforementioned development programs, we are seeking to advance a number of early-stage discovery programs in the areas of cancer metabolism, RGDs and metabolic immuno-oncology, or MIO, a developing field which aims to modulate the activity of relevant immune cells by targeting critical metabolic nodes, thereby, enhancing the immune mediated anti-tumor response.  The clinical development strategy for all of our product and development candidates includes a precision approach with initial study designs that allow for genetically or biomarker defined patient populations, enabling the potential for proof of concept early in clinical development, along with the potential for accelerated approval. Our ability to identify, validate and drug novel targets is enabled by a set of core capabilities. Key proprietary aspects of our core capabilities in cellular metabolism include our ability to measure the activities of numerous metabolic pathways in cells or tissues in a high throughput fashion and our expertise in ""flux biochemistry. This refers to the dynamic analysis of how metabolites, which are intermediates or small molecule products of metabolism, accumulate or diminish as they are created or chemically altered by multiple networks of metabolic enzymes."	1

We operate a portfolio of brands, including Tinder, Match, PlentyOfFish, Meetic, OkCupid, OurTime, and Pairs as well as a number of other brands, each designed to increase our users' likelihood of finding a meaningful connection. Through our portfolio of trusted brands, we provide tailored products to meet the varying preferences of our users. As a result, the market for dating products is fragmented, and no single product has been able to effectively serve the online dating category as a whole.  Given these wide ranging consumer preferences, our strategy focuses on a brand portfolio approach, through which we attempt to offer dating products that collectively appeal to the broadest spectrum of consumers. We work to apply a centralized discipline to learnings, by sharing best practices and technologies across our brands in order to increase growth, reduce costs and maximize profitability. Additionally, we centralize certain other administrative functions, such as legal, human resources, finance, tax, and others. significant growth in our mobile-first dating products, as well as a meaningful shift in the user bases of our previously desktop-oriented dating products, who have gone from accessing those products via desktop devices to accessing our mobile experiences for those products via mobile devices. This shift to mobile, along with the combination of our mobile-first dating products and the deployment of mobile experiences across substantially all of our previously desktop-oriented products, has enabled us to reach groups of users which had previously proven elusive, such as the 18-25 year old audience; for example, Tinder has been able to tap into this audience rapidly over the last few years. Additionally, in previously desktop-oriented products like Match, the shift to mobile has led to increased usage of our products, as mobile users on average access our products at meaningfully higher rates than users who access our products on desktop.  Enabling dating in a digital world Prior to the proliferation of computers and mobile devices, human connections traditionally were limited by social circles, geography and time. Today, the adoption of the internet and mobile technology has significantly expanded the ways in which people can build relationships, create new interactions and develop romantic connections. Additionally, the ongoing adoption of technology into more aspects of daily life continues to further erode biases and stigmas that previously prevented individuals from using technology to help find and develop those connections.  We believe that dating products serve as a natural extension of the traditional means of meeting people and provide a number of benefits for their users, including: •  : Dating products provide users access to a large number of like-minded people they otherwise would not have a chance to meet.  : The search and matching features, as well as the profile information available on dating products, allow users to filter a large number of options in a short period of time, increasing the likelihood that users will make a connection with someone.  : Compared to the traditional ways that people meet, dating products provide an environment that reduces the awkwardness around the process of reaching out to new people. : The nature of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices allow users to connect with new people at any time, regardless of where they are.  Depending on a person's circumstances at any given time, dating products can act as a supplement to, or substitute for, traditional means of meeting people. When selecting a dating product, we believe that users consider the following attributes:  Users generally associate strong dating brands with a higher likelihood of success and a higher level of security. Generally, successful dating brands depend on large, active communities of users, strong algorithmic filtering technology and awareness of successful usage among similar users.  : Demonstrated success of other users attracts new users through word-of-mouth recommendations. : Users typically look for dating products that offer a community or communities with which the user can associate. By selecting a dating product that is focused on a particular demographic, religion, geography or intent (for example, casual dating or more serious relationships), users can increase the likelihood that they will make a connection with someone with whom they identify. 	0

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 with the recommended dosing of 34 mg once a day taken as two 17 mg tablets. In June 2018, the FDA approved a 34 mg NUPLAZID capsule formulation that provides patients with the recommended 34 mg once daily dose in a single, small capsule, reducing patient pill burden compared to the previous administration of two 17 mg tablets. In addition, the FDA approved a 10 mg NUPLAZID tablet for patients concomitantly receiving strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, which can inhibit the metabolizing of NUPLAZID .  We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we are continuing to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis is one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we 1 announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 s tudy exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency , we initiated our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementi Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, major depressive disorder, or MDD, affects approximately 16 million adults in the United States, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy. In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in 207 patients with MDD who had a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line, SSRI or SNRI, antidepressant therapy. In the study, pimavanserin met the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and positive results were also observed in seven additional secondary endpoints including response rate, improvement in sexual function, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness. Pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated in the study with no meaningful weight gain or impact on motor function observed. In February 2019, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program for pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in the first half of 2019.  We also believe schizophrenia is a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address certain important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms.	1

Our vision is to connect local commerce, increasing consumer buying power while driving more business to merchants through price and discovery. We want Groupon to be the destination that consumers check first when they are out and about; the place they start when they are looking to buy just about anything, anywhere, anytime. We provide consumers with savings and help them discover what to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. By bringing the brick and mortar world of local commerce onto the Internet, Groupon is helping local merchants to attract customers and sell goods and services.  Groupon operates online local commerce marketplaces throughout the world that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services, generally at a discount. Consumers access those marketplaces through our websites, primarily localized groupon.com sites in many countries, and our mobile applications.  Our operations are organized into two segments: North America and International. W e offer goods and services through our online marketplaces in three primary categories: We earn product revenue from direct sales of merchandise inventory through our Goods category. We primarily earn service revenue from transactions in which we earn commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Those transactions generally involve a customer's purchase of a voucher through one of our online marketplaces that can be redeemed with a third-party merchant for specified goods or services (or for discounts on specified goods or services). Service revenue also includes commissions that we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications and from voucherless merchant offerings in which customers earn cash back on their credit card statements when they transact with third-party merchants.  The substantial majority of our service revenue transactions is comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. Our goal is to continue to build marketplaces that our customers rely on to discover and save on amazing things to do, eat, see, buy and where to travel. With a mobile-first strategy, we intend to improve the customer experience by continuing to invest in innovative, frictionless products and differentiated local supply coupled with strong national brands. As we build out our marketplaces, we want our customers to have a superior, frictionless experience when they use our product whether finding, booking, buying or redeeming an offer. For merchants, this includes providing capabilities to manage demand for their goods and services and improving their ability to acquire customers. For consumers, this includes easily finding offers and accessing features that augment the overall experience, as well as seamlessly purchasing and redeeming offers. We are currently investing in initiatives to improve the purchase and redemption experience, such as enhancing our mobile applications, testing offerings with voucherless redemption resulting in cash back directly to customers' credit cards, and adding direct booking capabilities. We ultimately want Groupon to become a daily habit for our customers and believe that significantly increasing the offerings available through our online local commerce marketplaces is critical to this goal. Our initiatives to grow our inventory of deal offerings include entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, identifying new distribution channels through which to sell our marketplace offerings, and continuing to optimize the activities performed by our sales teams. Additionally, we believe that our efforts to increase our customer value may improve the health of our marketplaces, making our marketing and promotional services more effective for the merchants who feature offerings on our platform.  Our initiatives to grow International gross profit include increasing our international marketing spending and leveraging enhanced marketing analytics, prioritizing more technology resources in order to expand and advance its product and service offerings, growing our inventory of deal offerings by entering into commercial agreements with third parties that enable us to feature additional merchant offerings through our marketplaces, and other initiatives.

Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates representing interests in ""pools"" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect  ""passed through"" to the security holders, after deducting GSE or U.S. Government agency guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), which are structured instruments representing interests in Agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific Agency CMO securities.  TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.  CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third-party; rather, ""credit risk transfer"" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. The reduced amount that issuers are obligated to repay to the security holders offsets the issuer's credit losses on the related pool of loans.  Non-Agency RMBS are securities backed by residential mortgages, for which payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of RMBS. Non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Residential non-Agency securities are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or nonprime mortgage loans."	1

Our marketing program is designed to build loyalty for the Dick's Sporting Goods brand while promoting our broad assortment of brand name sporting goods equipment, apparel and footwear in a specialty store environment. Our historical marketing strategy has consisted largely of newspaper advertising supplemented by direct mail and seasonal use of local and national television and radio. While we continue to market through these traditional channels, we have more recently developed brand-building marketing campaigns focused on building passion and loyalty to the Dick's Sporting Goods brand and have shifted our advertising focus toward digital marketing and personalization.

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

459	To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices of prescription drugs furnished under part D of the Medicare program.	"Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act of 2019

This bill requires the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies regarding prices for drugs covered under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. (Current law prohibits the CMS from doing so.)

The CMS must take certain factors into account during negotiations, including the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of the drug, the financial burden on patients, and unmet patient needs. If the CMS is unable to negotiate the price of a drug, such drug is subject to competitive licensing in order to further its sale under Medicare, notwithstanding existing government-granted exclusivities.

Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc.	We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company advancing a new therapeutic approach, including the development of proprietary product candidates, for the treatment of peanut and other food allergies. It is estimated that over 30 million people in the United States and Europe have a food allergy, with peanut allergy being the most prevalent and most commonly associated with severe outcomes and life-threatening events. There are currently no approved medical therapies to cure food allergies or prevent their symptoms. Patients with food allergies are typically counseled to practice strict dietary avoidance. When accidental exposure to food allergens invokes a serious allergic reaction, rescue therapies, such as antihistamines or injectable epinephrine, are the only recourse available. Our therapeutic approach, which we refer to as Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy, or CODIT TM , is designed to desensitize patients to food allergens and thereby reduce the risk of having an allergic reaction upon accidental exposure, or reduce symptom severity should an allergic reaction occur. CODIT is intended to reduce meaningfully the burden and anxiety experienced by food-allergic patients and their families.  Our lead CODIT product candidate, AR101, is an investigational biologic for the treatment of patients with peanut allergy, which affects approximately three million patients in the United States and three million patients in Europe. AR101 has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for the treatment of patients 4-17 years of age from the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Our initial target patient population is children and adolescents in the 4-17 age group, which we estimate will reach approximately 1.6 million patients in the United States alone during 2018.  In late 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 efficacy trial of AR101 in the United States, Canada and Europe, which we refer to as the PALISADE (Peanut Allergy Oral Immunotherapy Study of AR101 for Desensitization in Children and Adults) trial. We completed global enrollment of 554 patients between the ages of 4 and 49 in November 2016 and completed the final study for the PALISADE trial in December 2017. Patient demographics were generally balanced among patients ages 4-17 enrolled in the AR101 treatment arm as compared to those from the same age group enrolled in the placebo treatment arm.  After approximately one year of treatment, patients completed an exit double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC). Efficacy results for Intent-to-Treat, or ITT, group and for patients ages 4-17 who completed the AR101 treatment arm of the study, or Completers, are summarized in the charts below.  A total of 496 patients ages 4–17, from both arms (372 AR101 and 124 placebo), were evaluable for safety. An SAE is an adverse event that results in significant medical consequences, such as hospitalization, disability or death, and must be reported to the FDA. A total of 10 patients ages 4-17 experienced SAEs, none of which were considered life-threatening: nine of these patients were in the AR101 arm (2.4%) and one was in the placebo arm (0.8%). Of the nine AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 that experienced an SAE, five patients experienced mild or moderate SAEs. The other four AR101-treated patients experienced severe SAEs, which, for two of these patients, were not related to treatment (a concussion and a viral asthmatic exacerbation). Of the two AR101-treated patients ages 4-17 who experienced severe SAEs related to treatment, both of whom had elevated baseline peanut-specific IgE levels greater than 100 kU/L, one experienced anaphylaxis and the other experienced wheezing on the first day of treatment. Of patients ages 4-17, 12.4% of patients from the AR101 treatment arm and 2.4% of patients from the placebo-treatment arm discontinued due to investigator-reported adverse events.  In January 2018, we completed enrollment of 506 patients in our real-world experience safety trial of AR101 in the United States and Canada in patients ages 4-17, which we refer to as the RAMSES (Real-World AR101 Market-Supporting Experience Study in Peanut Allergic Children Ages 4-17 Years) trial. In addition, in July 2017, we began enrollment of our European Phase 3 efficacy trial designed with a higher efficacy bar of tolerating 1,000 mg of peanut protein in an exit food-challenge without anything more than mild, transient symptoms, which we refer to as the ARTEMIS	1

Sturm, Ruger & Co., Inc.	"Overview Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. and Subsidiary (the ""Company"") is principally engaged in the design, manufacture, and sale of firearms to domestic customers. The Company's design and manufacturing operations are located in the United States and almost all product content is domestic.  The Company primarily offers products in three industry product categories – rifles, pistols, and revolvers. The Company's firearms are sold through independent wholesale distributors, principally to the commercial sporting market.  The Company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys and metal injection molding (""MIM"") parts for internal use in the firearms segment and has minimal sales to outside customers. The Company presently manufactures firearm products, under the ""Ruger"" name and trademark, in the following industry categories: Rifles  Most firearms are available in several models based upon caliber, finish, barrel length, and other features.  A rifle is a long gun with spiral grooves cut into the interior of the barrel to give the bullet a stabilizing spin after it leaves the barrel. Net sales of rifles by the Company accounted for $243.0 million, $264.9 million, and $208.5 million of total net sales for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which typically is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. Net sales of pistols by the Company accounted for $176.2 million, $250.0 million, and $192.2 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  A revolver is a handgun that has a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of chambers which are successively aligned with the barrel of the gun during each firing cycle. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the gun and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder and cocks and releases the hammer. Net sales of revolvers by the Company accounted for $74.6 million, $104.9 million, and $113.3 million of revenues for the years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  The Company also manufactures and sells accessories and replacement parts for its firearms. Net sales attributable to the Company's casting operations (excluding intercompany transactions) accounted for $4.6 million, $5.9 million, and $6.2 million, for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Company produces one model of pistol, all of its revolvers and most of its rifles at the Newport, New Hampshire facility. Some rifle models and two pistol models are produced at the Mayodan, North Carolina facility.  Many of the basic metal component parts of the firearms manufactured by the Company are produced by the Company's castings segment through processes known as precision investment casting. The Company believes that investment castings and MIM parts provide greater design flexibility and result in component parts which are generally close to their ultimate shape and, therefore, require less machining than processes requiring machining a solid billet of metal to obtain a part.  Through the use of investment castings and MIM parts, the Company endeavors to produce durable and less costly component parts for its firearms.  All assembly, inspection, and testing of firearms manufactured by the Company are performed at the Company's manufacturing facilities. Every firearm, including every chamber of every revolver manufactured by the Company, is test-fired prior to shipment. "	1

472	A bill to provide humanitarian relief to the Venezuelan people and Venezuelan migrants, to advance a constitutional and democratic solution to Venezuela's political crisis, to address Venezuela's economic reconstruction, to combat public corruption, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering, and for other purposes.	"Venezuela Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance, and Development Act of 2019 or the VERDAD Act of 2019

This bill directs the President to take various actions to address the political situation in Venezuela. (The United States does not recognize Nicolas Maduro as Venezuela's President due to reports of widespread fraud during his election, recognizing instead National Assembly President Juan Guaido.)

The Department of State shall provide humanitarian aid to Venezuela and to Venezuelans in neighboring countries.

The bill imposes sanctions on foreign persons responsible for or complicit in corruption or activity undermining Venezuela's democratic institutions. Sanctions include barring entry into the United States and various financial restrictions.

The bill also (1) authorizes or imposes various sanctions targeting the Maduro regime's ability to finance debt, trade gold, and use cryptocurrencies; and (2) imposes visa-blocking sanctions on aliens acting on behalf of Russia to support Maduro regime security forces.

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma, retinal diseases and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to successfully commercialize our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") approved product, Rhopressa® (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% (""Rhopressa ® Rocklatan TM has a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (""PDUFA"") goal date of March 14, 2019. TM (named Rhokiinsa® and Roclanda TM, respectively, in Europe) for regulatory approval in Europe and Japan and expect to commercialize on our own in Europe and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan, if approved. We are also focused on furthering the development of our preclinical molecules and technologies focused on retinal diseases and expect to have two preclinical implants, AR-1105 and AR-13503, commence clinical trials in 2019. Further, we are screening our owned library of Rho kinase (""ROCK"") inhibitors for indications beyond glaucoma.  Rhopressa® is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is an Aerie-owned ROCK inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Early indications point to healthcare professionals prescribing Rhopressa® as a concomitant therapy to prostaglandins or non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) medications when additional IOP reduction is desired. We believe Rhopressa® is primarily competing with other non-PGA products, due to its targeting of the diseased trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, its preferred once-daily dosing relative to other currently marketed non-PGA products and its safety profile. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA. We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  We launched Rhopressa® in the United States at the end of April 2018. Rhopressa® is now being sold to national and regional U.S. pharmaceutical distributors, and patients have access to Rhopressa® through pharmacies across the United States. In the glaucoma market in the United States, approximately half of the dispensed volumes are covered under commercial plans and half under Medicare Part D. We have obtained formulary coverage for Rhopressa® for approximately 90% of lives covered under commercial plans and approximately 40% of lives covered under Medicare Part D plans. We expect Medicare Part D Tier 2 equivalent coverage to increase to over 70% by the end of the first quarter of 2019.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Rocklatan TM, is a once-daily fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Rocklatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Rocklatan TM, if approved and formulary coverage is obtained, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite using currently available therapies.  We submitted a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Rocklatan TM to the FDA in May 2018 under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the ""FDCA""), which provides for an abbreviated approval pathway, since Rocklatan TM is a fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs in the United States. In July 2018, we announced that the NDA was accepted for review by the FDA and the PDUFA goal date was set for March 14, 2019.  Our strategy also includes developing our business outside the United States, including obtaining regulatory approval in Europe and Japan on our own for Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Rocklatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization of their equivalents in Japan."	0

Duke Realty Corp.	"The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of bulk distribution (""industrial"") real estate.  The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986.  The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the ""Partnership Agreement""), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. At December 31, 2017 , our diversified portfolio of 509 rental properties (including 42 jointly controlled in-service properties with 11.2 million square feet, 12 consolidated properties under development with 7.2 million square feet and four jointly controlled properties under development with 2.0 million square feet) encompassed 148.8 million rentable square feet. Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 1,000 tenants whose businesses include e-commerce, government services, manufacturing, retailing, wholesale trade, and distribution. We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 1,900 acres of land and controlled an additional 1,600 acres through purchase options.  We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 20 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; Central Florida; Chicago, Illinois; Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Nashville, Tennessee; New Jersey; Northern and Southern California; Pennsylvania; Raleigh, North Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; South Florida; St. Louis, Missouri; and Washington We have two reportable operating segments at December 31, 2017, the first consisting of the ownership and rental of industrial real estate investments. The operations of our industrial properties, as well as our non-reportable Rental Operations (our residual non-industrial properties that have not yet been sold, referred to throughout as ""Non-Reportable""), are collectively referred to as ""Rental Operations. "" Our second reportable segment consists of various real estate services such as property management, asset management, maintenance, leasing, development, general contracting and construction management to third-party property owners and joint ventures, and is collectively - 4 - referred to as ""Service Operations. Our Service Operations segment also includes our taxable REIT subsidiary (""TRS""), a legal entity through which certain of the segment's aforementioned operations are conducted. As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.  We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also additional services such as build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.  All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator.

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on April 29, 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we plan to continue to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states.  For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis represents one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 study exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency on our clinical development plan, we initiated 1 our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hal lucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, in Oc tober 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  As a result of potential overlap of clinical sites and study participants between the HARMONY study and our Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease agitation and aggression, which we refer to as SERENE, we decided to discontinue enrollment of new patients in that study. We also believe schizophrenia represents a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address some very important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as the inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated two studies evaluating the adjunctive use of pimavanserin in patients with schizophrenia. ENHANCE-1 is a Phase 3 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in patients with an inadequate response to their current antipsychotic therapy. ADVANCE is a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  Depression is another disorder with a high unmet need that we believe represents an attractive development opportunity for pimavanserin. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that patients with depression often do not receive adequate relief from an antidepressant medication, and, due to side effects of currently available therapies, many patients discontinue their medication, significantly increasing their chance of relapse. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests 5-HT 2A antagonism may be an effective adjunctive therapy to currently prescribed antidepressants. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. Our strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative small molecule drugs that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the discovery, development, and commercialization of our product opportunities. We complement our management team with scientific and clinical advisors, including recognized experts in the fields of PD Psychosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and other CNS disorders.	1

Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit AMD's ability to compete effectively; AMD has a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements, manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm) from GF with limited exceptions. is dependent upon its technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products 1 to operate its business; the markets in which AMD's products are sold are highly competitive; AMD's worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on it; AMD's issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of its common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of AMD's existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes) may dilute the ownership interest of AMD's existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of its common stock; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD's products could materially adversely affect it; the demand for AMD's products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: •x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets; discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors and semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles.  We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function.  A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the ""brain"" of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU's internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed.  Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership.  A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.  GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)).  In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving).

For entities that are certified by the Department of the Treasury as special access food providers using specified criteria, the bill allows tax credits for operating a new grocery store or renovating an existing grocery store in a food desert. The bill also authorizes grants for a portion of (1) the construction costs of building a permanent food bank in a food desert, and (2) the annual operating costs of temporary access merchants (mobile markets, farmers markets, and food banks).

Treasury, in coordination with the Department of Agriculture (USDA), must annually allocate the tax credits and grants to special access food providers. Grants authorized by this bill are not considered gross income for tax purposes.

The bill also requires USDA to update the Food Access Research Atlas at least annually to account for food retailers that are placed in service during that year."	Walmart, Inc.

"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We are preparing for our launch of commercial sales of Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018. After the adoption of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion, we expect a final decision regarding the MAA from the European Commission before the end of 2019. We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.

479	To require a report on the effects of climate change on the Coast Guard, and for other purposes.	This bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to submit a report on the vulnerabilities of Coast Guard installations as a result of climate change over the next 20 years, including an overview of mitigations that may be necessary to ensure the continued operational viability of the vulnerable installations.	Pool Corp.	Business General Pool Corporation (the Company, which may be referred to as we, us or our) is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the top three distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States. Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life. Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.  As of December 31, 2018, we operated 364 sales centers in North America, Europe, South America and Australia through our four distribution networks:  We participate in a worldwide market for outdoor living products through our four distribution networks.  We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools. Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products. Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.  These favorable trends include the following: • long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, which contributes to the growing installed base of pools that homeowners must maintain; • increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment; •  consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and •  consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.  Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools. Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool's appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.  The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2017 P.K. Data, Inc. reports): The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools. The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.  New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.  The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long‑term growth rates. Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single‑family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables.	0
480	A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve access to health care through expanded health savings accounts, and for other purposes.	"Health Savings Act of 2019

This bill modifies the requirements for health savings accounts (HSAs) to

 rename high deductible health plans as HSA-qualified health plans; allow spouses who have both attained age 55 to make catch-up contributions to the same HSA; make Medicare Part A (hospital insurance benefits) beneficiaries eligible to participate in an HSA; allow individuals eligible for hospital care or medical services under a program of the Indian Health Service or a tribal organization to participate in an HSA; allow members of a health care sharing ministry to participate in an HSA; allow individuals who receive primary care services in exchange for a fixed periodic fee or payment, or who receive health care benefits from an onsite medical clinic of an employer, to participate in an HSA; include amounts paid for prescription and over-the-counter medicines or drugs as ""qualified medical expenses"" for which distributions from an HSA or other tax-preferred savings accounts may be used; increase the limits on HSA contributions to match the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket expenses permitted under a high deductible health plan; and allow HSA distributions to be used to purchase health insurance coverage. The bill also: (1) exempts HSAs from creditor claims in bankruptcy, and (2) reauthorizes Medicaid health opportunity accounts.

The bill allows a medical care tax deduction for: (1) exercise equipment, physical fitness programs, and membership at a fitness facility; (2) nutritional and dietary supplements; and (3) periodic fees paid to a primary care physician and amounts paid for pre-paid primary care services."	Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	"We are an ophthalmic pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma and other diseases of the eye. Our strategy is to commercialize Rhopressa ®, approved by the FDA on December 18, 2017, in North American markets and advance our product candidate, Roclatan TM, to regulatory approval. We are in the process of hiring a commercial team that will include approximately 100 sales representatives to target approximately 12,000 high prescribing eye-care professionals throughout the United States. If we obtain regulatory approval, we currently expect to commercialize Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in Europe on our own, and likely partner for commercialization in Japan.  Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we issued and sold approximately 2.3 million additional shares of our common stock, for which we received net proceeds of approximately $136.2 million, after deducting fees and expenses, upon the completion of the ""at-the-market"" offering that commenced in December 2017 and pursuant to an underwriting agreement, dated January 23, 2018, related to a registered public offering.  Our FDA-approved product, Rhopressa ®, is a once-daily eye drop designed to reduce elevated intraocular pressure (""IOP"") in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The active ingredient in Rhopressa ®, netarsudil, is a Rho kinase inhibitor. We believe that Rhopressa® represents the first of a new drug class for reducing IOP in patients with glaucoma in over 20 years. Based on clinical data, we expect that Rhopressa® will have the potential to compete with non-PGA (prostaglandin analog) products as a preferred adjunctive therapy to prostaglandin analogs (""PGAs""), due to its targeting of the diseased tissue known as the trabecular meshwork (""TM""), its demonstrated ability to reduce IOP at consistent levels across tested baselines, and its preferred once-daily dosing relative to currently marketed non-PGA products. Adjunctive therapies currently represent nearly one-half of the glaucoma prescription market in the United States, according to IQVIA (formerly known as IMS Health). We believe that Rhopressa® may also become a preferred therapy where PGAs are contraindicated, for patients who do not respond to PGAs and for patients who choose to avoid the cosmetic issues associated with PGA products.  Our advanced-stage product candidate, Roclatan TM, is a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of Rhopressa® and latanoprost, the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. We plan to submit a New Drug Application (""NDA"") for Roclatan TM to the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. We believe, based on our clinical data, that Roclatan TM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-reducing effect than any currently marketed glaucoma medication. Therefore, we believe that Roclatan TM, if approved, could compete with both PGA and non-PGA therapies and become the product of choice for patients requiring maximal IOP reduction, including those with higher IOPs and those who present with significant disease progression despite use of the currently available therapies.  We own the worldwide rights to all indications for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM.  We have patent protection for Rhopressa® and Roclatan TM in the United States through at least 2030 and internationally through dates ranging from 2030 to 2037. Our intellectual property portfolio contains patents and pending patent applications related to composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of use, and synthetic methods.  Our collaboration with DSM, a global science-based company headquartered in the Netherlands, provides access to their bio-erodible polymer technology, and our acquisition of assets from Envisia Therapeutics Inc. (""Envisia""), which includes the right to use PRINT® manufacturing technology for ophthalmology, are designed to 1 advance our progress in developing potential future product candidates to treat retinal diseases. Aided by these technologies, we are developing two preclinical molecules focused on retinal disease. AR-13503, for which we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug application (""IND"") in 2019, is an Aerie-owned Rho kinase and Protein kinase C inhibitor with potential in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (""AMD""), diabetic retinopathy and related diseases of the retina, such as diabetic macular edema (""DME""). As the active metabolite of AR-13154(S), AR-13503 has shown lesion size decreases in an in vivo preclinical model of wet AMD at levels similar to the current market-leading wet AMD anti-VEGF product. Also preclinically, when used in combination with the market leading anti-VEGF product, AR-13503 produced greater lesion size reduction than the anti-VEGF product alone in a model of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, through the Envisia asset acquisition, we are also developing AR-1105, a preclinical dexamethasone steroid implant with potential in the treatment of DME, and currently expect to submit an IND in late 2018.  Further, we are evaluating our owned library of Rho kinase inhibitors for potential indications beyond ophthalmology."	1

483	A bill to amend the Federal Trade Commission Act to prohibit anticompetitive behaviors by drug product manufacturers, and for other purposes.	Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act of 2019 This bill prohibits patent thicketing and product hopping by drug manufacturers. In general, patent thicketing occurs when a drug manufacturer obtains new patents related to a previously-patented drug, biological product, or underlying chemical composition that extends the manufacturer’s market exclusivity for that drug without demonstrating that the new patents serve a meaningful purpose other than limiting competition from generic drug manufacturers. Product hopping is presumed when a drug manufacturer obtains removal of a drug from the Food and Drug Administration’s approved drug list, discontinues a drug, or markets a reformulation of an already-approved drug during a certain period after which the manufacturer has been notified that a competing drug manufacturer has applied for generic drug approval. These practices are not considered product hopping if the manufacturer demonstrates that the drug was removed from the approved-drug list for safety reasons. Or, in the case of a drug reformulation, the manufacturer shows that the modified product provides a significant health benefit, is the option least likely to reduce competition, and is based on substantial financial considerations unrelated to limiting competition. The Federal Trade Commission may penalize violating manufacturers and bring claims in federal court to prohibit the conduct and provide restitution.	8x8, Inc.

Companies are looking to increase their competitive edge by integrating their communications with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Human Capital Management (HCM) applications, and other back-office IT (information technology) systems within their infrastructure. Further complicating matters, business users are circumventing their IT departments by using a variety of self-selected third-party tools for team communication and collaboration, driving a shift in the buying center for communications and collaboration from IT to individuals, a phenomenon known in the industry as ""shadow IT. "" 8x8 integrates across CRM/ERP (such as Netsuite or Bullhorn), service and support (such as Zendesk or Salesforce sales cloud), and other productivity/collaboration tools (slack or G-suite, for example), providing seamless access, unified analytics, and business flexibility to 8x8 customers. This is supported by 8x8 through its data security and compliance certifications, including HIPAA, FISMA and ISO 27001,which meet or exceed the requirements of government and industry agencies around the world.  Many other legacy business processes have already experienced the move to the cloud phenomenon. Examples include companies using legacy front office applications switching to cloud providers like Salesforce.com, Inc., or the use of IT management applications migrating to industry disruptors such as Servicenow, Inc. Business communications applications are following suit as the next major business segment to migrate to the cloud. Businesses today face increasing cost and complexity with deployments of communications and collaboration solutions. Companies of all sizes are managing a global, distributed workforce that seeks to leverage multiple forms of communication in their day-to-day interactions. The rapid rise of mobile devices in the enterprise has created demand for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) integration as part of a typical business' communications needs. We believe that 8x8 is an industry disruptor (in the same vein as Salesforce was for front office applications or Servicenow was for IT applications), across three large markets: unified communications, video meeting solutions, and contact center applications. Our platform, which offers capabilities and functionality across all three areas in one integrated technology stack provides a complete cloud offering that enhances productivity and business insight. Combining these services allows our customers to eliminate information silos and expose vital, real-time communications data spanning multiple services, applications and devices which, in turn, can improve productivity, business performance and customer experience.  Traditionally, small businesses were the first to transition their communications to the cloud starting several years ago, due to cost effectiveness, ease of deployment and inherent flexibility."	0

United Airlines Holdings, Inc.	"As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. The Company transports people and cargo throughout North America and to destinations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,800 flights a day to 353 airports across five continents, with hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport (""Newark""), Chicago O'Hare International Airport (""Chicago O'Hare""), Denver International Airport (""Denver""), George Bush Intercontinental Airport The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under Alliances below, United is a member of Star Alliance, the world's largest alliance network.  The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as United Express.  This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our hubs and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. a CommutAir (""CommutAir""), ExpressJet Airlines (""ExpressJet""), GoJet Airlines (""GoJet""), Mesa Airlines (""Mesa""), SkyWest Airlines (""SkyWest""), Air Wisconsin Airlines (""Air Wisconsin""), and Trans States Airlines (""Trans States"") are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (""CPAs"").  Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier costs) for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics, subject 3 to annual adjustments. The fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures), while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred, as well as landing fees and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company, and, in some cases, the Company owns or leases some or all of the aircraft subject to the CPA, and leases or subleases, as applicable, such aircraft to the regional carrier.  In return, the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such CPA exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its MileagePlus® loyalty program.  United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2019 , Star Alliance carriers served over 1,300 airports in 193 countries with 18,800 daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways In addition to its members, Star Alliance includes Shanghai-based Juneyao Airlines as a connecting partner.  United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star Alliance members, codesharing of flight operations (whereby one carrier's selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras S.A. In addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air partners, United also offers a train-to-plane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark on select city pairs in the northeastern United States.  United also participates in four passenger joint business arrangements (""JBAs""): one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes, one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand and one with Avianca and Copa Airlines, which, upon receipt of regulatory approvals will cover routes between the United States and Central and South America, excluding Brazil. These passenger JBAs enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering enhanced customer benefits, such as highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. United also participates in cargo JBAs with ANA for transpacific cargo services and with Lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services. These cargo JBAs offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers' respective combined networks. "	0

Alphabet, Inc.	That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history -- inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with Android and map the world with Google Maps. Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which is Google. It also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main internet products in areas such as self-driving cars, life sciences, internet access and TV services. The Internet is one of the world's most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. So whether you're a child in a rural village or a professor at an elite university, you can access the same information. We are helping people get online by tailoring digital experiences to the needs of emerging markets. For instance, our digital payments app in India, now called Google Pay, helps tens of millions of people and businesses easily pay with just a few taps. We're also making sure our core Google products are fast and useful, especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns.  For instance, Loon announced that it will bring its balloon-powered internet to regions of central Kenya, starting in 2019.  People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer, popular browser. The power of machine learning Across the company, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more useful -- it's what allows you to use your voice to ask the Google Assistant for information, to translate the web from one language to another, to see better YouTube recommendations, and to search for people and events in Google Photos. Our advertising tools also use machine learning to help marketers find the right audience, deliver the right creative, and optimize their campaigns through better auto-bidding and measurement tools. Machine learning is also showing great promise in helping us tackle big issues, like dramatically improving the energy efficiency of our data centers.  Across Other Bets, machine learning helps self-driving cars better detect and respond to others on the road, assists delivery drones in determining whether a location is safe for drop off, and can also help clinicians more accurately detect sight-threatening eye diseases.  We have always been a company committed to building products that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google's core products and platforms such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users. Our vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation 3  that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems. As the majority of Alphabet's big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus that we' Instead of just showing ten blue links in our search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for. You can also type or talk with the Google Assistant in a conversational way across multiple devices like phones, speakers, headphones, televisions and more. And with Google Lens, you can use your phone's camera to identify an unfamiliar landmark or find a trailer from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily -- like Google Maps, which helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos. 	0

Public Storage	"We acquire, develop, own and operate self-storage facilities , which offer storage spaces for lease on a month-to-month basis, for personal and business use. We are the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in the U.S. We have direct and indirect equity interests in 2,429 self-storage facilities that we consolidate (an aggregate of 162 million net rentable square feet of space) located in 38 states within the U.S. operating under the ""Public Storage"" brand name.  Ancillary Operations : We reinsure policies against losses to goods stored by customers in our self-storage facilities and sell merchandise, primarily locks and cardboard boxes, at our self-storage facilities.

We believe Shurgard Europe is the largest owner and operator of self-storage facilities in Western Europe.  We also manage 33 self-storage facilities for third parties . We are seeking to expand our third-party management operations to further increase our economies of scale and leverage our brand; however, there is no 5 assurance that we will be able to do so. We also own 0.8 million net rentable square feet of commercial space which is managed primarily by PSB .  For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code"") . and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.  We believe that our customers genera lly store their goods within a three to f ive mile radius of their home or business . Our facilities compete with nearby self-storage facilities owned by other operators using marketing channels similar to ours , including Internet advertising, signage, and banners and offer services similar to ours . A s a result, competition is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates, rental income and operating expenses of our facilities.  In the last three years, there has been a marked increase in development of new self-storage facilities in many of the markets we operate in, due to the favorable economics of development which we have also taken advantage of. These newly developed facilities compete with many of the facilities we own, negatively impacting our occupancies, rental rates, and rental growth. This increase in supply has been most notable in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, New York, and Portland.  Ownership and operation of self-storage facilities is highly fragmented. As the largest owner of self-storage facilities, we believe that we own approximately 7 % of the self-storage square footage in the U.S. and that collectively the five largest self-storage owners in the U.S. own approximately 15 %, with the remaining 8 5 % owned by numerous regional and local operators.  We believe that we have significant market share and concentration in major metropolitan centers, with approximately 71 % of our 201 8 same-store revenues generated in the 20 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (each, an ""MSA"", as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) with the highest population levels. Industry fragmentation also provides opportunities for us to acquire additional facilities; however, we compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors who also view self-storage facilities as attractive investments.

ACADIA Pharmaceuticals, Inc.	We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in central nervous system, or CNS, disorders. We have a portfolio of product opportunities led by our novel drug, NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson's disease psychosis, or PD Psychosis, and is the only drug approved in the United States for this condition. NUPLAZID is a selective serotonin inverse agonist, or SSIA, preferentially targeting 5-HT 2A receptors. Through this novel mechanism, NUPLAZID demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing the hallucinations and delusions associated with PD Psychosis in our Phase 3 pivotal trial and has the potential to avoid many of the debilitating side effects of existing antipsychotics, none of which are approved by the FDA in the treatment of PD Psychosis. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to pimavanserin. We launched NUPLAZID in the United States in May 2016 with the recommended dosing of 34 mg once a day taken as two 17 mg tablets. In June 2018, the FDA approved a 34 mg NUPLAZID capsule formulation that provides patients with the recommended 34 mg once daily dose in a single, small capsule, reducing patient pill burden compared to the previous administration of two 17 mg tablets. In addition, the FDA approved a 10 mg NUPLAZID tablet for patients concomitantly receiving strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors, which can inhibit the metabolizing of NUPLAZID .  We believe that pimavanserin has the potential to address important unmet medical needs in neurological and psychiatric disorders in addition to PD Psychosis and we are continuing to study the use of pimavanserin in multiple disease states. For example, we believe dementia-related psychosis is one of our most important opportunities for further exploration. In December 2016, we 1 announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 s tudy exploring the utility of pimavanserin for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease psychosis, or AD Psychosis, a disorder for which no drug is currently approved by the FDA. Following our End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and agreement with the agency , we initiated our Phase 3 HARMONY relapse prevention study in October 2017, which allows us to evaluate pimavanserin for a broader indication than AD Psychosis alone. More specifically, HARMONY will evaluate pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis, which includes psychosis in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease dementia, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementi Furthermore, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to pimavanserin for dementia-related psychosis.  According to the National Institute of Mental Health, major depressive disorder, or MDD, affects approximately 16 million adults in the United States, with approximately 2.5 million adults treated with adjunctive therapy. The majority of people who suffer from MDD do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant therapy. In October 2018, we announced positive top-line results from CLARITY, a Phase 2 study evaluating pimavanserin for adjunctive treatment in 207 patients with MDD who had a confirmed inadequate response to existing first-line, SSRI or SNRI, antidepressant therapy. In the study, pimavanserin met the pre-specified primary and key secondary endpoints with statistical significance and positive results were also observed in seven additional secondary endpoints including response rate, improvement in sexual function, and a reduction in daytime sleepiness. Pimavanserin was generally well-tolerated in the study with no meaningful weight gain or impact on motor function observed. In February 2019, we conducted an End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the FDA and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 program for pimavanserin as an adjunctive treatment for MDD in the first half of 2019.  We also believe schizophrenia is a disease with multiple unmet or ill-served needs and we are currently exploring the utility of pimavanserin in this area. Despite a large number of FDA-approved therapies for schizophrenia, current drugs do not adequately address certain important symptoms of schizophrenia, such as inadequate response to current antipsychotic treatment of psychotic symptoms and negative symptoms.	1

Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (""Internal Revenue Code""). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT.

The majority of our properties in the United States (""U.S."") are wholly owned, while our properties outside the U.S. are generally held in co-investment ventures, to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency movements.  Our irreplaceable portfolio is focused on the world's most vibrant markets where consumption and supply chain reconfiguration drive logistics demand. In the developed markets of the U.S., Europe and Japan, key demand drivers include the reconfiguration of supply chains (strongly influenced by e-commerce trends), the demand for sustainable design features and the operational efficiencies that can be realized from high-quality logistics facilities. In emerging markets, such as Brazil, China and Mexico, growing affluence and the rise of a new consumer class have increased the need for modern distribution networks. Our strategy is to own the highest-quality logistics property portfolio in each of our target markets. These markets are characterized by what is most important for the consumption side of a logistics supply chain — large population centers with proximity to labor pools, surrounded by highways, rail service or ports. The DCT portfolio of logistics real es tate assets wa s highly complementary to our portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential.

Activision Blizzard, Inc.	"Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services.

On February 23, 2016 (the ""King Closing Date""), we acquired King Digital Entertainment, a leading interactive mobile entertainment company (""King""), by purchasing all of its outstanding shares (the ""King Acquisition""). We made this acquisition because we believed that the addition of King's highly complementary mobile business positioned us as a global leader in interactive entertainment across mobile, console, and PC platforms, and aligned us for future growth. Our Strategy and Vision Our objective is to continue to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences on a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; driving deep consumer engagement; and providing more opportunities for player investment.  We endeavor to reach as many consumers as possible either through: (1) the purchase of our content and services; (2) engagement in our free-to-play games, which allow consumers to play games with no up-front cost but provide for player investment through sales of downloadable content or via microtransactions; or (3) engagement in other types of media based on our franchises, such as esports and film and television content.  Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game's release, delivering more value to our players and additional growth opportunities for our franchises.  Increasingly, our consumers are connected to our games online through consoles, PCs, and mobile devices. This allows us to offer additional digital player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in certain of our games and franchises by purchasing incremental  ""in-game"" content (including larger downloadable content or smaller content, via microtransactions). These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. Further, if executed properly, additional player investment can increase engagement as it provides more frequent and incremental content for our players. In addition, we have begun to generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment through esports, film and television, and consumer products.

The factors of the test include

Our primary investments consist of Agency pass-through certificates representing interests in ""pools"" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect  ""passed through"" to the security holders, after deducting GSE or U.S. Government agency guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), which are structured instruments representing interests in Agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific Agency CMO securities.  TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.  CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third-party; rather, ""credit risk transfer"" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. The reduced amount that issuers are obligated to repay to the security holders offsets the issuer's credit losses on the related pool of loans.  Non-Agency RMBS are securities backed by residential mortgages, for which payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency. Instead, a private institution such as a commercial bank will package residential mortgage loans and securitize them through the issuance of RMBS. Non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Residential non-Agency securities are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or nonprime mortgage loans."	1

Our clients are generally middle-income consumers, which we define as households with $30,000 to $100,000 of annual income. According to the 2016 U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey, the latest period for which data is available, almost 50% of U.S. households fall in this range. Many have inadequate or no life insurance coverage. Individual life insurance sales in the United States declined from 12.5 million policy sales in 1975 to 10.2 million policy sales in 2016, the latest period for which data is available, according to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association International, Inc. (""LIMRA""), a worldwide association of insurance and financial services companies. We believe that term life insurance, which we have provided to middle-income clients for many years, is generally the best option for them to meet their life insurance needs.  Many need help saving for retirement and other personal goals."	1

As the global leader in complement biology and inhibition for more than 20 years, Alexion has developed and commercializes two approved complement inhibitors to treat patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), as well as the first and only approved complement inhibitor to treat anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody positive. Alexion also has two highly innovative enzyme replacement therapies and the first and only approved therapies for patients with life-threatening and ultra-rare metabolic disorders, hypophosphatasia (HPP) and lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D).  In addition to our marketed therapies, we have a diverse pipeline resulting from internal innovation and business development. Alexion focuses its research efforts on novel molecules and targets in the complement cascade and its development efforts on the core therapeutic areas of hematology, nephrology, neurology, metabolic disorders and cardiology. We focus our product development programs on life-transforming therapeutics for rare diseases for which current treatments are either non-existent or inadequate. We have developed or are developing innovative products for, among others, the following indications: Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH)  PNH is a chronic, progressive, debilitating and life-threatening ultra-rare blood disorder characterized by intravascular hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) that is mediated by an uncontrolled activation of the complement system, a part of the immune system. Chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life-threatening thromboses, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, impaired quality of life, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark-colored urine (hemoglobinuria).  aHUS is a severe and life-threatening, ultra-rare genetic disease characterized by chronic uncontrolled complement activation and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, causing a reduction in platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and life-threatening damage to the kidney, brain, heart and other vital organs. 	0
499	To provide better care and outcomes for Americans living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers while accelerating progress toward prevention strategies, disease modifying treatments, and, ultimately, a cure.	Concentrating on High-value Alzheimer's Needs to Get to an End Act of 2019 or the CHANGE Act of 2019 This bill modifies the requirements under Medicare for diagnosing and treating Alzheimer's disease and other cognitive impairments in older adults. Specifically, the bill expands the cognitive impairment detection benefit during annual wellness visits to require the use of validated detection tools and documentation of the results in the patient's medical record. Further, when a cognitive impairment is detected, the patient must be referred to an appropriate diagnostic service provider and other specified supports. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services must implement Medicare policies that increase the identification and response to patients' Alzheimer's disease risk factors and incentivize providers to utilize high-quality cognitive impairment diagnosis practices. The Government Accountability Office also must conduct a study of policies that may accelerate progress in Alzheimer's disease research and enhance the quality of care for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.	Acorda Therapeutics, Inc.	"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies that restore function and improve the lives of people with neurological disorders. We are preparing for our launch of commercial sales of Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder), which is approved for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa. Inbrija is an on-demand treatment that utilizes our innovative ARCUS pulmonary delivery system, a technology platform designed to deliver medication through inhalation that we believe has potential to be used in the development of a variety of inhaled medicines. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018. The approval is for a single dose of 84 mg, with no titration required. We expect Inbrija to be commercially available in the first quarter of 2019 and to be distributed through a network of specialty pharmacies. Our preparations for the commercial sale of Inbrija continue, including sales force training and education, managed care discussions, market research and social media initiatives. We are seeking approval to market Inbrija in the European Union, and accordingly we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in March 2018. After the adoption of a Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, opinion, we expect a final decision regarding the MAA from the European Commission before the end of 2019. We currently derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of Ampyra. We have been engaged in litigation with certain generic drug manufacturers relating to our five initial Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents. In 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (the ""District Court"") issued a ruling that upheld our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patent that expired on July 30, 2018, but invalidated our four other Orange Book-listed patents pertaining to Ampyra that were set to expire between 2025 and 2027. Under this decision, our patent exclusivity with respect to Ampyra terminated on July 30, 2018. We appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""Federal Circuit""), which issued a ruling on September 10, 2018 upholding the District Court's decision (the ""Appellate Decision""). In January 2019, the Federal Circuit denied our petition for rehearing en banc. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from generic versions of Ampyra that are being marketed following the Appellate Decision. We expect that additional manufacturers will market generic versions of Ampyra, which may accelerate the decline in our Ampyra sales.  Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) : Launching the commercial sale of Inbrija in the U.S.; obtaining approval of our European MAA for Inbrija; and continuing with potential partnering discussions for commercialization outside of the U.S.  ARCUS Platform : Advancing our efforts to develop additional therapeutics based on our proprietary ARCUS pulmonary drug delivery technology, looking at central nervous system, or CNS, as well as non-CNS opportunities, including our program to develop an ARCUS-based treatment for acute migraine.  Company Highlights Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder)/Parkinson's Disease Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) is the first and only inhaled levodopa, or L-dopa, for intermittent treatment of OFF episodes, also known as OFF periods, in people with Parkinson's disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa regimen. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for Inbrija was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, on December 21, 2018.
