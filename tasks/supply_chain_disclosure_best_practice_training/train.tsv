"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

 

Abbott believes in being a socially responsible company and doing what is right, not just by our customers, but by the world in which we live. Abbott is committed to safe and fair working conditions, beyond our employees and the stores in which our products are sold, but also extending to the partners in our supply chain. Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.

 

Abbott’s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery. Abbott’s internal Code of Business Conduct also incorporates standards prohibiting slavery/trafficking or engaging in illegal behavior. Abbott requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Abbott’s products comply with local and national laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. In particular, Abbott employees worldwide train annually on Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct. Likewise, all contractors assigned to Abbott are required to review and abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct.

 

Employees and contractors assigned to Abbott who fail to abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct may be subject to reprimand or other adverse consequences, up to and including termination of employment or assignment. Abbott provides training to its employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, regarding human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products."

"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 

Human trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. 

Verification 

In order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. 

Auditing 

To ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. 

For the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. 

Certification 

All business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that ""Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors."" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. 

Internal Accountability 

We have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. 

Training and Awareness 

All internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. 

All of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking."	Yes
"In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and will go into effect on January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. 

Acer is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), an alliance of the world’s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. 

Acer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC’s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. 

Acer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: 

Supplier risk assessment 

Acer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers’ operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.

Supplier audits 

Acer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.

Additionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer’s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.

Supplier Declaration 

Acer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer’s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.

Supply Chain Management Employee Training 

Acer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer’s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer’s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code."

"Corporate Responsibility and the Siemens Supply Chain*

Supplier Code of Conduct

Siemens wants to be perceived as an integral part of the national society and economy in all countries. Due to the huge diversity of conditions at the 177 countries in which we purchased goods and services in the last Fiscal Year (Oct 1st - Sept 30), this maxim of Siemens‘ business policy was considered in the principles of the “Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers”. It is based on – among others – the UN Global Compact and the principles of the International Labor Organization but also reflects the Siemens “Business Conduct Guidelines”, which establishes fundamental principles of sustainability and apply to the entire company.

Siemens operates not only in accordance with clear Business Conduct Guidelines, which are mandatory worldwide, but also with directives to concentrate business with only the best suppliers who agree to and comply with our standards in the supply chain. In the long term we cooperate only with suppliers who place as much value on Sustainability as we do and who adhere to the principles of Global Compact with respect to human rights and work relationships.

In order to continuously monitor and improve the performance of our suppliers we utilize a consistent Supplier Management System. At the foundation of this system is our process by which we obtain supplier contractual commitment to responsibilities towards their stakeholders and the environment through the Siemens Supplier Code of Conduct. The code addresses the following concepts:

		Compliance with laws. 

		Prohibition of Corruption and Bribery 

		Respect for Basic Human Rights of Employees (which includes to refuse to employ or make  anyone work against his or her will) 

		Prohibition of Child Labor 

		Health and Safety of Employees 

		Environmental Protection 

		Promotion of the above principles in the supply chain of the supplier  The full Supplier Code of Conduct document and detailed description of the key provisions can be found under the following link: https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx)  Once a supplier becomes part of the Siemens supply chain, it then becomes subject to the compliance verification activities established as part of the Supplier Management System. The system uses a combination of four approaches to accomplish the compliance verification process. These approaches are: Sustainability Self Assessments, Risk Evaluations performed by the responsible Siemens Buyer, Sustainability Audits performed by third parties and Siemens Quality audits. These audits include determining if the supplier adheres to the Code of Conduct. Further information on our systematic approach can be found at www.siemens.com/sr/detection-modules  Siemens Management System considers the assessment and audit findings and then employs supplier development actions which establish improvement measures to be taken by suppliers to mitigate or correct issues raised in audit findings. If a supplier fails to execute the agreed upon measures, Siemens may terminate any existing business with the supplier. This termination right is established in Siemens supplier contracts and purchase terms and conditions. 

 

The number of 3rd party audits and number of findings are published in the Siemens Sustainability Report, and can be accessed through the following links: (www.siemens.com/scm/sustainability; or specific suppliers chapter under : http://www.siemens.com/sustainability/pool/en/current-reporting/sr2010_suppliers.pdf).

Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers

In order to orient our entire supply chain in an ecological manner, we work closely with our suppliers to identify and implement measures for the efficient use of resources and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, we developed our Energy Efficiency Program for Suppliers (EEP4Suppliers) which provides access to know-how and experience from our own Environmental Program and Environmental Portfolio.

In fiscal 2010, we successfully piloted EEP4Suppliers at 17 production facilities operated by major suppliers. Plans call for the first 1,000 suppliers to be integrated in the EEP4Suppliers program by the end of fiscal 2012.

Organization Awareness.

All Procurement professionals within the Siemens Supply Chain organization are trained on the “One Supplier Certification” process and related Code of Conduct requirements so that the principles can be effectively explained to suppliers. Additionally Siemens conducts sustainability workshops with our suppliers in higher-risk-countries. The workshops include presentations by Environment, Health and Safety Officers who lead break-out sessions that address human right topics such as worker safety.

Web Based Trainings in Sustainability are available for suppliers as well as internal Siemens personnel and can be accessed through the following link. https://w9.siemens.com/cms/supply-chain- management/en/sustainability/expectations/principles/Pages/code-of-conduct.aspx

"SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY

For many years, 99 Cents Only Stores has had in place a policy against purchasing any merchandise manufactured as a result of human trafficking or slavery and, in fact, as a result of any coercive, abusive, or unlawful practice.

In 2004, 99 Cents Only Stores adopted the following policy, which has been on its intranet at all times since:

“It is the Company’s policy not to purchase products known to be manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices. This means not purchasing products known to be manufactured by the use of: forced labor, abusive labor practices, child labor, or other practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.”

Given the largely closeout nature of much of the Company’s merchandise, its price points, and the ever-changing nature and composition of the merchandise it purchases and offers for sale, it is not feasible for the Company to comprehensively verify product supply chains or audit supplier compliance, but the Company does send its own employees to a number of the overseas factories from which it buys product for tours and announced inspections. Further, the Company also requires its direct suppliers to certify, in writing, that their products sold to the Company are not the result of any proscribed practices and that the supplier complies with the laws of all countries in which the supplier does business. In fact, the Company’s vendor contracts contain the following requirement:

“It is Purchaser’s policy not to purchase products manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices, such as forced labor, abusive labor practices, or child labor. Neither will Purchaser buy merchandise made as a result of any practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured. By signing or shipping under 99 Cents’ PO, Seller attests to the fact that after a diligent inquiry, Seller has ascertained that no product that is the subject of this Purchase Order has been manufactured using any such forced, involuntary, exploitive, or unfair labor practices.”

 Any supplier found to have falsely certified its compliance with the Company’s policy will no longer be used by the Company as one of its vendors. The Company’s buyers are also expected to comply with this policy, although it is not feasible for the Company to maintain a formal accountability program or to provide regular training on these topics to employees and managers operating in these areas, for the same reasons explained above."

"Company Disclosure Statement Pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

Alere supports the rights of all individuals to be free from slavery in the workplace.

When entering into written contracts with its suppliers, Alere policy is to include in those contracts a requirement that they comply with laws applicable to the business being transacted, which include laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. By signing our contracts our suppliers certify that they conduct their business in compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to laws that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. A supplier's failure to honor its legal and contractual obligations to Alere would be a violation of law and a breach of contract. Alere endeavors to do business with reputable suppliers with proper business standards. Alere does not believe that additional verifications or independent audits are necessary to ensure that its suppliers comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business."
